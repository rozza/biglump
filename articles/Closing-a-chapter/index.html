        <p>Being diagnosed with Cancer at 36 years old is one of those things.  We’d just moved into our forever house, Ross was really enjoying work, I was working 4 days a weeks as a Software Development Team Leader and we were comfortable.  Things had started to be less of a struggle.  And then, Bam!, everything gets spun around and we, as are family, are left reeling and wondering which way is up.</p>

<p>I continued to work throughout the initial operations and Chemotherapy, mainly working from home.  Unfortunately this left me extremely fatigued and as a result my energy levels for spending with the bairns and Ross were depleted.  They weren’t getting anything from me, nevermind the best of me.</p>

<p>After our break to Center Parcs, I had my big operation, and I haven’t been back to work since.  I found I was still suffering with fatigue, and the Oncologist assured me that this was perfectly understandable after all the treatments I’ve been through.</p>

<p>In the May half term I was able to have some great days with the bairns and just enjoy being a Mummy.  Generally followed by a long nap.</p>

<p>My work had been going through a lot of changes as a result of a joint venture between two big European companies.  As a result of this there was some restructuring and I was given the opportunity to take Voluntary Redundancy.  Ross and I decided that it was something I should go for.  My priority needs to be my family.  </p>

<p>Luckily for me, my application was successful, and yesterday was officially my last day at work.  I have mixed feelings about it, I worked there for four years, and met some really interesting people.  I also learned a lot, and hopefully I’ll be able to transfer that to any new job I get in the future.</p>

<p>Things are going to be tight for us until I start working again, but you can’t put a price on being here, being with my family.  We’ll manage.</p>

<p>I’ll pop in and collect my photo’s of the bairns once I’ve finished my radiotherapy and say goodbye to everyone properly.</p>
