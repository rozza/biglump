        <p>Ross and I have almost finished the Christmas shopping.  Lists are being made in preparation for Christmas Day food shopping, and the cupboards are getting stocked with Goodies.</p>

<p>We’ve had confirmation that my chemo will run weekly starting next Thursday, so we’re trying to get everything done before that starts.  I had a few of the Gin Club ladies round for coffee on Friday morning which was lovely.  I’m not going to have a chance to do that again until all the cycles have finished in February.</p>

<p>On Saturday, we went to see Cinderella at the theatre in Stevenage.  It was great fun, and we all enjoyed it very much.  Ross nearly had a close call with an Ugly Sister, but having Felix sat beside him saved him.</p>

<p>In the evening it was the Gin Club Christmas dinner at The George in Baldock.  Sadly, Lesley missed it as she had a stomach bug, but everyone else made it, and we had a lovely time.  It wasn’t as rowdy as it’s been in the past, but it was still very nice.  The food was good, and I enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine.  I was one of the first to leave, but I still stayed out later than I thought I would and Ross was starting to get a bit worried by the time I did get in.  (Sorry Ross).</p>

<p>I had to style my hair carefully for the evening, as it’s coming out in clumps now.  I have some bald patches, but with some careful positioning and some spray wax, I think I got away with it.  I googled how long it would take for my hair to fall out completely, and I didn’t really find a definitive answer, although I did find someone’s rather upsetting hair loss video diary.  Everyone is different.  I’m having to sleep wearing a hat in an effort to try and contain the hair that’s falling out.  It’s not very comfortable, but it’s doing the job.</p>

<p>Over the next week or so, I’ll probably start wearing the bandanas and scarves I’ve got on standby. I’m a bit worried about that to be honest as it’ll become obvious to the world that I’m a Cancer patient. The school run is becoming a daunting prospect as are the Christmas concerts I’ve got to attend over the next week.  I don’t particularly want to be gossiped about by people who don’t know me on the school playground.  I’m probably being over sensitive, and no one will notice or care, especially if I utilise the trusty wooly hats I’ve got.  Thank goodness it’s winter!</p>

<p>Sunday was a rather quiet affair for me, only venturing out to Sainsbury’s for some lunch , and then a long nap on the sofa.  Ross kept the kids entertained by taking them to their swimming lessons, and also for a walk followed by a drink at the Orange Tree.</p>

<p>There’s still some family politics rumbling on.  Ross and I are under extreme pressure at the minute and if allowances can’t be made for that, then there’s something wrong.  I don’t have the energy to deal with it at the minute.  My priority has to be getting through the next 10 weeks as best I can and making Christmas as normal as we can for Imogen and Felix.  They are and always will be my reason for fighting.</p>
