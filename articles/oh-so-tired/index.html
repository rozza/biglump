        <p>Yesterday, I went to watch the kids have their swimming lesson.  Imogen’s teacher came to  wish us a lovely holiday and gave us a few handy hints on what to do whilst we are at Center Parcs.</p>

<p>When she’d gone the woman who was sat beside me said, “I couldn’t help overhearing, is it the Easter holidays you are going?” When I said, no it was Monday she asked if my daughter was at school.  I responded by saying both my children were at school, and she asked, rather incredulously, “and the school are ok with that?”.  Now, the swimming pool is hot, and I was sat with my baldy head out.  She clearly hadn’t joined the dots.  I turned to look at her and said, “I’m having treatment for breast cancer.  We’ve had precious little quality time as a family since my diagnosis, and thankfully the school has agreed that these are exceptional circumstances.”</p>

<p>To be honest I was a bit stunned by this exchange.  This woman was judging me for taking my kids out of school.  Believe me, it wasn’t a decision that we took lightly, but the children have been under a lot of stress recently.  It manifests itself in a few different ways.  Tantrums, bed wetting, nightmares, etc.  Imogen and Felix deserve a few days away with their parents to make some magical memories before having more treatment.</p>

<p>I crashed on the sofa for the rest of the day.  I hope I have more energy for the holiday.</p>

<p>Today was spent watching rugby training, and then getting organised for holiday.  I can’t wait.</p>
