The drugs are administered, and it's all fine.  Once I'm finished they need to keep an eye on me as I could have a reaction to the Herceptin, so we wait for a few hours.

During this time, I'm given more steroids to take to reduce the chances of sickness over the next 3 days. I also have a lesson in injecting myself with an immunity boosting syringe.  That was quite odd.  All the times I've had needles stuck in me over the past 6 weeks or so, it's always been someone else doing it, so I can look away and let them get on with it.  Not so this one, I have to actually stick it in myself.  I had a practice run with a dummy needle and a stress ball, then it was time for the main show.  There was an awkward pause whilst I took a deep breath, steeled myself and went for it.  Luckily it was fine.  The nurse was happy with my attempt and I'll be trusted to do it unsupervised in future.

I have my port site checked and they are also pleased that's healed sufficiently so it looks like I'll be able to have a bath tonight. :-)

At the designated time we were told they were happy, and we could go.  Before long we are home sitting down to lasagna with the bairns and grandparents.

After tea, and a catch up on Pointless, I have my aforementioned bath, and then it's off to bed.  It's been a long couple of days, and I need to make sure I rest.  Ross goes to the pub.
