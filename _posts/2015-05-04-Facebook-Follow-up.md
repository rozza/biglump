This weekend I've been called a Facebook Warrior, as I am quite active on Facebook whilst also dabbling in Twitter.  (Does that make me a Twitter Twerp?)  Anyway, when I was writing it, it became clear that I needed to write a proper blog post for it because there was a lot of information I wanted to get across and lots of links to other sites.

The original post was prompted by Rio Ferdinand's wife, Rebecca, dying on Friday from breast cancer.  Here is what I said:

>"It's easy to think that Breast Cancer is one thing of the "best" cancers to get. But we should not get complacent. Breast Cancer kills. It is ignorant and non discriminating, and it's pot luck if those who are diagnosed live or die.

>Rebecca Ferdinand had been given the all clear, but it returned and sadly she died on Friday, aged 35, leaving her 3 kids without a Mummy. Heartbreaking.

>Lisa Lynch, in The C Word, on tonight, was also given the all clear, only for the Cancer to return.

>Cancer is a Bitch. I'll always be wondering whether my luck will change and we'll have the Bitch come back. In the meantime, I'll be living my life, enjoying watching my bairns grow up.

>I'll also be raising money for Cancer Research, because we need to stop ladies like Rebecca and Lisa dying."

Being told you have Cancer is horrendous.  Your life flashes in front of your eyes and you are suddenly given a very harsh lesson in the limitations of your own mortality. Whilst the medical team try and assure you that they hope to rid your body of Cancer, you are acutely aware that this disease has the potential to end your life.  (Insert your own Bad Swear here.)

According to [Breast Cancer Campaign](http://www.breakthrough.org.uk/research/secondary/what-secondary-breast-cancer), nearly 1,000 women in the UK die from breast cancer each month. Most of these deaths are from where the original breast cancer has spread to other parts of the body like liver, brain or bones.  Every month, 1000 families are left devastated at the loss of a Wife, Mum, Grandma, Sister, Aunt, Daughter.  1000 families discover that Breast Cancer isn't the 'best' type of cancer to get, that it's not easy to treat and are left with a gaping hole that no amount of condolences will fill.  Families like those of Rebecca Ellison, Lisa Lynch, Lulu and Rachel.  The latter two being ladies I've come across on my own cancer journey.

We must continue to raise awareness to get women (and men) to know what the signs of breast cancer are.  Get familiar with your breasts, find out what's normal and see the doctor if something's not right.  Early detection is key.  Check out [Breakthrough Breast Cancer's](http://www.breakthrough.org.uk/about-breast-cancer/touch-look-check) guide for more information.

We must also continue to raise funds for research into finding a cure for Cancer.  Whilst Cancer is not pink and fluffy, if a pink and fluffy event gets people raising money, then that's got to be a good thing.  So, if I can do the Race for Life and the Pretty Muddy one, you can sponsor me.  [Sponsor the Gin Club at Race For Life](https://www.justgiving.com/the-gin-club-2015/)

Don't underestimate Cancer.  It sucks.
