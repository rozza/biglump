I received a letter today confirming in writing that I have Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in two different places.

Obviously we've known I have cancer, but this is the type of cancer it is.  It gives it a name.  The good news is that it's the most common sort of breast cancer, so they should know how to treat it.  The next thing we need to know us the stage and grade.  We may find that out tomorrow when we go to the see the Consultant, but I have a feeling they won't know the whole sorry story until after I've had my mastectomy and they get a chance to examine it fully in a lab somewhere.

In other news I went to the doctors to sort out a repeat prescription for the anti-cancer drugs I'll be talking for the next 5 years.

We also ordered a new mattress.  The one we have is 11 years old and very lumpy.  So we decided that as I'm probably going to be spending quite a while in bed over the next few months, I might as well be comfy.  It gets delivered on Thursday.

A kindly neighbour dropped round with some apple cake too.  It seems word is getting round in the street we've been living in for 2 and half months. She was very kind and said all the right things.  We are lucky.
