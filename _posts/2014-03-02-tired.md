Things have been slowly getting back to normal.  I've watched the bairns swimming lessons and Imogen's gymnastics for the first time in months.  I've watched them play rugby in the freezing cold at the rugby club.  I've driven to the office.  I've had the Gin Club round for birthday drinks, and it's been great.  But I've noticed that the fatigue is still hanging around.  If I have a busy day, the next day will normally involve a nap.  I'm still not sleeping well, so that's having an impact.  But it's going I the right direction.


I've been getting lots of messages of support.  They really do mean a lot to Ross and I.  I have to admit being disappointed in some people, but have to accept everyone will react in different ways to this sort of thing.  We are relying on a lot of support at the minute, and in the words of Billy Ocean, "When the going gets tough, the tough get going."  Thank you to everyone who has helped out, in any way, shape or form.  It's very much appreciated.


And in other news, it's my Dad's birthday today.  Happy birthday Dad. X
