I'm slightly aghast that I haven't written on this blog for over a year.  I've been adding posts to Facebook about how things are progressing. But this blog has been neglected.  Mainly because it is a faff to update with the SVN and what not.

When I last did a blog post, I nonchalantly mentioned Cyberknife on my neck and sacrum.  What I didn't realise that this would involve a full head 'cage' for want of a better word.

She even has her own Instagram account: @willow_the_apricot-labradoodle .

So, back to me.

My oncologist is keen for me to have Cyberknife on the two new tumours.  This needs to be approved by the powers that be.  Hopefully, that will be straightforward, and the treatment can happen quite quickly.  I'm hoping that it'll all be done and dusted by the time we get to February half term, so we can go on holiday and celebrate my birthday.  If it doesn't get approved, I'm not sure what the next option would be, but lets keep our fingers crossed for Cyberknife.

For now, I'll keep on keeping on. Business as usual.

As a side point, I'd  like to thank all of the reader's of my blog.  To all the people I know and to those I don't.  This is just a journal of a normal woman going through something tough, health wise, whilst trying to maintain as much normality for me and my family as I possibly can. I know I don't update it very often, but there are sometimes extra bits on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamLawley/">Big Lump and the Lawley's Facebook page</a>. I do what I can.  Writing the blog and updates are a cathartic process for me, and, I hope, an informative one for you. xx
