Ross and I are very much stuck in the moment at the minute.  We are keeping our heads down and dealing with the immediate things that need to be dealt with.  With everything that is going on we can only ask for patience and understanding.  We may not get everything right all the time, but hey, being diagnosed with cancer pretty much means all bets are off and normal rules don't apply.  We are trying our best.

After the weekends adventures we had to have a bit of a debrief from those overseeing my care.  So, I've spoken to two nurses, two doctors and a ward sister so far today.  Just a regular day in the Lawley house.  I'm still having chest pains,  but I'm still taking the painkillers and the Oncologist has asked me to get a prescription from my GP to try something else too.

Ross and I are both working at home today.  My Immune system is probably at it's weakest, so it's best to stay away from the great unwashed at the minute.  I'm glad that I have the option to work at home as it means I feel like I'm being useful and I'm not rotting my brain by watching daytime tv.  (My colleagues may not actually agree with that though...)

The bairns were lovely this morning.  Both came in and gave me a lovely hug before they went off to breakfast club.  I love my kids, I am so proud of them and they amaze me every single day with their resilience and ability to plough on.  I am truly lucky to be their mum.  Yes, they get shouted out every so often, but who cares.  They don't.  They know they are loved and are confident and secure in themselves and our little family unit.

Pinky dropped off a very kind and thoughtful set of gifts.  I'm looking forward to opening them all later with the kids.  Thank you Pinky. x
