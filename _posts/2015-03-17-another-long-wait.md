It seems I've found myself in the midst of another long wait.

Since the beginning of the year, I've had two CT scans, two MRI scans and an ultrasound scan.  That's quite a lot of scans.  The Multi-disciplinary team have discussed me three times and at last, this week I heard the decision.

It's good news.  All the scans and blood tests indicate that this lump is benign.  Yay!  It still needs to be removed as it's unlikely to go away by itself, and the 'wait and see' option isn't really an option when I want to have reconstruction at some point this year.

So, I'm booked in to have surgery on the 11th of May.  It'll involve at most one night in hospital, and I'll be out of action for a week, but it is so good to be able to make plans around a date.  So many things were being put off, or only tentative plans made, but this is great.  I'm pleased.
