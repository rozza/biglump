Xkcd is webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language - if you haven't seen
it before then you should check it out: [xkcd.com](http://xkcd.com/).

There's a few strips about breast cancer as his fianc√© contracted it a few years
ago and as I was surfing today and happened upon his lanes strip and it seemed
apt.

Oh - I've also added one to Julia's last post as it was relevant ;)
