Ross went into London for a geek meet, so I was home alone.  At lunchtime, I pulled the boxes of Christmas decorations out, and put up a few festive ornaments.  When Ross got home, I supervised him putting up some more lights, the tree and when the bairns came home they helped me decorate it.  The problem we have us that we don't have enough decorations for the new house!  The front room looks great, but there is nothing in the kitchen/dining room.  This obviously needs to be rectified.  Especially as we're having Christmas at home this year.
