I awake at 3:30 for some reason, Grandad is in the loo and I need to spend
a penny.  I head downstairs and just as I'm turning off a light I hear a pop
upstairs and the lamp downstairs switches off.  Then Julia is shouting and I
rush upstairs it seems the iPad charger has exploded and tripped all the sockets.

The plug is covered in soot and the charger is in two parts - wowzers on later
inspection the charger is a counterfeit apple charger :( The good news is that Julia's temp is good
but she mentions some chest tightness.

In the morning I'm happy that Julia's temperature is back to normal and she heads
off to have her wig cut. Grandad and I take Felix to little ruggers and read the
paper whilst Felix charges about with a huge grin - he loves little ruggers.
When I get home Julia tells me the car lights on for a flat - so I head to Tescos
to fill it up and find one very low tire, a slow puncture just what I need and I
plan on getting it sorted asap.

I get home and Julia is more concerned about her chest. We try and phone the
nurse and the on-call mobile seems to have gone off line.  A couple of calls to
the hopsital and we get through and Julia is ordered to A&E.

Imogen is devistated that we can't take her to dancing but I'm focused on the one
with chest pains so when asked, I decline to draw a map to dance studio - I've got
places to be, sorry Grandparents you're in charge of the 7 year old howler.

We get to A&E, Julia signs in and I head off to get the car in the proper car
park. When I come back, there's no Julia so I get directed to her.  They've done her
blood pressure and temp and decided she should be put in a side room on her own and not
with the rest of the sick plebs.

Julia has an ECG, they take blood and order an x-ray.  They don't tell us the
results of the ECG and that concerns me.  We sit and wait for someone to tell
us what's going on.  It's a well known fact that Hospital time breaks all known
rules of the universe. Each second drags, a minute lasts a eon but hours happily
roll by. I think it's an elaborate illusion by your brain to protect you from the mind
numbing teadiousness of it all.

We've seen a consultant and lots of things have been ruled out, so they need to do
more blood tests.  The A&E sister has had enough of us hogging the side room
and we are moved back with the great unwashed to a new waiting room in the CDU.  There's
some family there with a lad my age who has a swollen face, seems it's a big day
out for them all.  The quick blood tests take hours and eventually Julia tactfully complains
that we've been there 7 hours and she has **cancer**, someone takes the hint
and a Nurse offers her food five minutes later - No luck for me they've just
run out.  I snag some ginger snaps from Julia's handbag.

The consultant comes back, hes a good bloke but is happy lots of bad things have
been ruled out but also concerned nothing has been ruled in.  Possibly a side
effect or the start of an infection. He wants her to stay overnight for
observations, Julia pleads her case to be sent home and we are given strict
instructions - **any** new symptons or **any** worsening then come back in.  He
also refers us for an ambulatory review for Monday / Tuesday.

We head home, Julia is too shaky to walk to the carpark, so I run round to fetch
the car.  I'm starving so dive into the chippy for some lunch / tea.  I get home
and Julia takes her meds and goes to bed. My mum and dad have been great and had
the kids all day no problems, they tell us they are a credit to us.

There are some downsides, it seems, as having the kids all day seem to have
effected my Mum, her tact button and support button seems to have been turned
off and stamped on. I'm tired and sensitive but for some reason she manages to
wrap well meaning comments into belittling and/or critisims and my blood boils.
It's really not the best time to ask me "What will you do tomorrow if Julia is ill?"
because they are heading home, well I'll deal with it, that's what I'll do.
Yes it was a shame Imogen missed her dance lesson but I wasn't in a state to
draw a map and explain how to get there to them, I had a higher priorty item
and it was simpler to not go.  I nearly lost it when she talked about Julia's
diet - can't always eat fish and chips, I explain they were **my** fish and
chips and I got them because I only had 3 biscuits since breakfast over 12 hours
before.  After clearing up that misconception, I mention I also have
frozen some meals, for my troubles I'm told she also needs fresh veg with it.
FFS I'm not superman, if we are so tired I only cook one of our frozen meals
then Julia and I will cope. For some reason it's important to know if Julia was
doubled over in pain it got asked twice. I know my Julia and she has a high pain
threshold and its not relevant anyway, chest pain == hospital for chemotherapy
patients end of, there is no grey area here only one big massive warning light.

I head to bed before I shout, after a day in A&E I only needed understanding and
a bit of peace. It takes me over an hour to calm down and find the land of nod.
I know she meant well and by morning I'm over it but there are ways and means and
I really needed understanding and listening last night not advice for the future.

There's no rule book or even guide book on how to cope with a loved one having
cancer. It impacts us all - family and friends, all in very different ways. We
have to remember that and accept that no one's perfect and keep working and helping
each other.

It's great we are now getting Julia better but, my, it's still an emotional
rollercoaster. The tears that were so effective at being a pressure valve when
the initial shock of the diagnosis have long gone. I need to find a replacement,
I tried meditating, exercise and even a good session in the pub. All help but none
so quick a fix as a good cry, lets hope writing this all down also works well.
