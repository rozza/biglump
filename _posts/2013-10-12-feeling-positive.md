We firstly took Merlin to the vets to get his first lot of jabs.  The vet was happy  he was a sociable cat, and gave plenty of advice.

Then it was off to Little Ruggers and ballet.  A quick razz around Sainsburys and it was back home.

Lunch was followed by the ironing, then sorting the under stairs cupboard and then a sit on the sofa watching Bondi Vet.

I started to get a bit low during that, so after seeing some pictures, made our sloe gin and blackberry vodka.  Imogen and Felix helped.

Dinner came soon after and them we watched Strictly.

Merlins been a bit lethargic today, but that's down to the jabs.

Ross has managed to alter his schedule and he's coming home tonight instead of Monday.  This makes me happy.
