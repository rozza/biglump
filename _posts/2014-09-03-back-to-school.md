I'm probably in the minority here, but I don't think the holidays were long enough.  Just as we got into the swing of things, it was time for them to go back.

Of course, they are very excited about this.  Felix is looking forward to playing with his friends again, and Imogen is looking forward to learning to play the flute.  I am going to have to find myself things to do during the day whilst they aren't here.

Ross is going to have to come with my to my appointments again.  The bairns came with me the last couple of times I had Herceptin.  It's quite nice to sit in a room with them and listen to them chatter on.
