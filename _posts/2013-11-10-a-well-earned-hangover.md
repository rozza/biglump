I rub Julia's shoulder but it seems that she's done herself a mischief whilst
asleep and pulled the stitches.  It's painkillers and bed for her this morning.

Imogen helps by coming with me to take Merlin to the vet, a jab and microchip
later and he's nearly ready to go outside.  The vet reckons to give a week and
praises Merlin for being a rounded cat, the needle for the chip was massive and
he just gave a miaow as it happend.  The vet also thinks 7 year old girls are
the best thing for cats to make them domesticated.  Luckily, we have one of those.

I get home and Julia is in the bath, she's in tears because she's reading
"The Cancer Journey" its about staying postive, conquering fear and staying
healthy.  The prospect of chemotherapy is shit scary and Julia has been so
brave for the last few weeks and it briefly becomes overwhelming.  I hug her and
tell her I'm there every step of the way and we'll get through it together.
When things become massive and overwhelming we have to take things one day at a
time.  The big picture can be soo frightening its incomprehensable.
The conversation crashes like a stormy sea around my head all day - advice is
easy to give and hard to take it seems.

I ask Imogen to keep and eye on Mummy and give her hugs if needed and I take
Felix to little ruggers.  Felix loves little ruggers and I spent the time talking
geek to another dad.  In the afternoon, I notice the garage roof is more banjaxed
than previously thought. Water is leaking into the garage and down the brick work
outside. I phone and book some builders to come round and give us quotes.

In the evening it's Adam and Heathers wedding celebration, Julia and I have been
looking forward to this for ages!  The baby sitter arrives and Julia and I
practically skip to the pub.  Its a great night, Julia enjoyed it but left early,
I walked her home and then headed back. I drank a lot and probably was
dismal, self-absorbed company, hopefully not too much.  Adam and Heather - thank you
for letting me bend your ears at the end of the night, it was good therapy and sorry
for doing so at your wedding celebration (timing is not my strong point).

Sunday morning arrives all too quickly and I've won myself an epic hangover.
It's painkillers and bed for me this morning.  Julia is determined that Felix
and Imogen go to swimming, so gets up and drives them. I'm pleased she does
as my two fishes both move up a level!

I'm not at my best and take the morning off and then swap with Julia for the
afternoon and she goes to bed.  I pump up a rugby ball and take the kids out.  We pass the ball in
line and do some kicks.  The weather is good, sunny and fresh and the autumn
leaves look especially good this year.

Its been a heck of a few weeks and all eyes are now on Tuesday, to some extent
we'll be treading water until we see the consultant.
