Last week The Independent, re-shared a story about <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/91-year-old-inspired-thousands-skipping-chemotherapy-to-go-on-end-of-life-road-trip-dies-a7345951.html?cmpid=facebook-post">a 90 year old lady, Ms Bauerschmidt, who was diagnosed with uterine cancer</a> in the summer of 2015 and rather than go along with the standard treatment of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, she decided that she would, instead, go on the roadtrip of a lifetime.  After a year on the road, driving 13,000 miles, staying in over 75 locations in 32 states, she died in October 2016.  The article wasn't a sad one, it was a happy one.  Ms Bauerschmidt's motto was "Say 'Yes' to Living", and packed in so much into that year.

After reading the heartwarming article, it got me thinking about my treatment and if saying "No" to it was an option.  (Spoiler Alert...it's not.)  Ms Bauerschmidt was 90 when she was diagnosed with her primary cancer.  I was 36, and at the time, Imy and Felix were 5 and 7.  Ross and I had been married for less than 10 years.  So, I decided to comment on the post and said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline/posts/10154620732761636">"I think if I was 90 and told that I had Stage 4 Cancer ( there is no Stage 5, it's already spread outside the primary cancer site) I would do that. But I'm not. I'm 40, with two young children and I need more time."</a>

Now, in Internet Land, we all know there are Trolls, I'm not completely niave, but I didn't expect what I thought to be an innocuous comment to receive some of the comments it did.  And I learned this the hard way.

The headline of the article was "91-year-old who inspired thousands by skipping chemotherapy to go on end of life road trip dies".  It's slightly misleading.  She didn't refuse chemo alone,  she refused all treatment options.  So my response wasn't just based on a refusal of chemo, it was all treatments: biological; hormonal; chemo; radio; surgey.

I didn't expect anyone to even look at the comment, nevermind give me their opinion on it. The majority of the comments were positive, encouraging ones: "I wish you well with your treatment.", "You're in my prayers.", "All the best.", etc.  Thank you people.

So far, so good.  And then this:

Hold on... what?  Chemo gives you cancer?  I need to find out what "caused" my cancer and cut it out?  I have learned over the years I've been on Facebook that sometimes it's not about retaliating, it's about just leaving things alone.  Except, how can I leave it alone?  This person has just jumped to huge conclusions about my treatment and life and decided to tell me how I should be living my life.  Erm...no.  I think not.  I had to acknowledge the comment as it was so preposterous and I think I was rather restrained in my reply!

My original comment has been like over 300 times.  Most people get where I'm coming from.  And yet, this person comes back again.  Really?
