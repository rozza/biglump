I thought I'd deal with it better than I am to be honest.  It's only hair.  It'll grow back as soon as the treatment finishes in February.  But I'm feeling a bit sad.

I went into the office yesterday, which I found ridiculously tiring.  Just getting up, getting the kids to breakfast club and then driving to Bedford took it out of me.  I was shattered.  It was good to see everyone, but it's clear that if I'm going to be much more productive working at home.

I'm working at home today, as is Ross and there's men putting a new garage roof on.  The old one had holes in it and wouldn't have kept the contents of the garage dry over the winter, so the last of the moving house fund has gone on getting it replaced.  I'll have to wait until I'm better before we can start saving towards the other things we want to do, including getting a new fire put in.

As I'm sat here, more hair is falling out and I've got quite a pile next to me now.  I wonder how long it'll be before I decide enough is enough, and I shave it off?  I've got a wig and some bandana's all ready, it's just harder than I thought it would be, and I'm a bit disappointed with myself.
