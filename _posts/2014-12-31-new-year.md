Ross and I took the bairns for a walk this morning and we discussed New Year's Resolutions.  My main aim for 2014 was to stay alive.  I've managed it 100% with less than 12 hours to go!

In a blog post from the [12th April](http://teamrj.co.uk/articles/happiness-and-sadness/), I said "I’ve added a few things to my to do list: sort the garden, stain/paint some furniture, do a 10k run, do a Race for life Pretty Muddy, and do a triathlon. What’s to stop me? Only my own mental attitude. At least that’s on my side!"

I can check a couple of them off too.

I painted our bedside tables, and was very pleased with the results.  I'll definitely be doing another project.
I did the Standalone 10k with Michelle.

Depending on recovery from surgery, I'll be signing up for a Pretty Muddy event in June, and a triathlon later in the year.  If I don't do it in 2015, I'll do it in 2016.  

Imogen, Felix and I have signed up for the Race for Life 5k run again, as we all enjoyed it so much last year.

So much to do, and I have the time to do it thanks to the wonders of modern medicine.
