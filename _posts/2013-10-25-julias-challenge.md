description: "Woke at 6:15am after some trippy dreams.  Out of nowhere I was
feeling so down as if the emotions of the last few days had still been building
to boiling point in my sleep. I was sobbing and couldn't stop."

I hugged Julia tight and my sobs woke her. Not the nicest way to start the day
for her and I feel guilty for doing it. It's as if my emotions have betrayed me
somehow. We talk and I feel better - it seems crying really works.

Seems we forgot to set Felix's alarm last night, Julia set me a challenge to
set Felix's alarm on without waking him. (I still haven't got round to WD40'ing
the door hinges upstairs, they're straight out of a noir horror film - almost
comically so). I creep in set it and retreat. Julia tells me the "on" setting
is up. Bugger, I'd just turned it off. I creep in again, set the alarm and Felix
rolls over, snores loudly (atta boy) and then wakes... oops.

The kids wake, we get hugs from the kids and get them to school. I'm
apprehensive, as ours friends know but we've yet to see them. It's as if
seeing them makes it more real. Stupid really, seeing them give Julia hugs
and talking about it is **enormously** reassuring. There were tears and disbelief
but I see it brightens Julia - we are lucky to have such great friends.

Julia has messages to do this morning, so I'm back home having a coffee and on
the laptop. I buy our old domain back and hunt for a blog engine, Jekyll wins as
it's easiest and has themes.  We get the blog up and I grab Julia's diary
entries and throw it on the web (o hai!).

I tell work and friends on twitter, the support messages are great.  Cancer
isn't a rarity, many stories of how it touched peoples lives have come out and
in a strange way it's good to hear.

I think I'll have a beer tonight and look forward to the firework display tomorrow.
Next week it's half term and time to chill with the kids and see family.
