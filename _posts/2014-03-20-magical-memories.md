We've cycled everywhere and been swimming every day.  The kids have been on the indoor climbing wall, and as a family we've been bowling twice, eaten out a few times, spent a fortune at the amusements, played ping pong and pool, painted pottery, played crazy golf and went on an aerial tree adventure.

It's our first holiday here, and I can safely say, we'll be back.  It's been so wonderful, and we've laughed and smiled pretty much permanently.

I've managed to keep going most of the time, but I think I'll need to catch up on some sleep when I get back.  I wouldn't change it for the world.
