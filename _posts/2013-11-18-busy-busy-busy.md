## Friday

Up and at 'em after a terrible nights sleep on the lovely new matress.  Julia
was worried she would fall out and took over two thirds of the bed and no
amount of snoring would get her to move!

Felix bounded out of bed as it's Children In Need and pyjama day at school.
Imogen was less excited about the idea of the early rising. Michelle was a star
and took the kids at 6:30am as we dashed down the A1 and onto the M25 for the
9am appointment in Rickmansworth.

The staff were great and we soon found out about Julia's operation.  No general
anethestic needed so Julia was happy. I had some coding to do, so spent the
waiting period working and watching lectures for the online course I'm doing.

A short time after Julia is wheeled out, she's back and still chilled out
from the sedatives.  She looks a million times better than she did after the
general and is keen for food and drink so they can discharge her.

Once free we have to take some bloods to Harpenden so Julia can be signed fit
for chemotherapy.  At the hospital Julia gets to meet the chemotherapy nurses
and they talk us through the process.  This answers some questions and wierdly
it all now feels more "normal" now.

We get home and Julia rests up. I get the kids from school but by 8:30pm I
can't stay awake and head up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire.

## Saturday

Julia seemed less scared about falling off the bed and we both manage to get a
good nights sleep.  It's my parents 45th wedding anniversary today, I didn't
think we'd make it but Julia is feeling well enough to go.  So we head off
to Newbury.  The M25 is a nightmare and we park for 30mins, I'm just glad it was
easy running the day before.  Once that wrinkle is out the way, we cruise to
Newbury and surprise my parents by phoning from outside their flat.  We have
a great lunch, it's brilliant to see the family and to see Julia looking so great
and enjoying some fizzy wine! We head back in the early evening tired and
happy.  Julia is sore from Fridays operation and plans to have a well deserved
lie-in the morning.

## Sunday

I let Julia rest and take the kids to their swimming lessons.  We swim for an
hour and then after a cuppa it's time to head home and do the chores.  I head
to the tip, do the laundry, go shopping, do the tidying and the cooking.  We
are now eating more vegetables and I'm not a fan of raw veg but it's time to get
over that.  Felix is less enthusiastic initially but the kids barter between
themselves - some of the pepper slices for cucumber and peace is restored.  I
even smile whilst showing Felix I now like raw tomatos!

In the afternoon I play some Lego Star Wars with the kids then I bully Julia
into an afternoon walk.  The doctors have said that exercise will help...
Its a grey old day, but the kids chase me kicking the rugby ball round Ivel
Springs.  We head home via the Orange Tree for a cheeky pint. Good day.

## Monday

My parents arrive at lunchtime they are over for the week to help out.  I take
them on the school run to pick up the kids and meet the teachers so they know
where to get them later in the week.

In the evening Julia has her ECG the whole thing was funny, the Doctor was great,
slightly disorganised but the tells Julia she has a perfect heart.  We are
good to go for Wednesday.
