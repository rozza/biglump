Yesterday, I went to watch the kids have their swimming lesson.  Imogen's teacher came to  wish us a lovely holiday and gave us a few handy hints on what to do whilst we are at Center Parcs.

When she'd gone the woman who was sat beside me said, "I couldn't help overhearing, is it the Easter holidays you are going?" When I said, no it was Monday she asked if my daughter was at school.  I responded by saying both my children were at school, and she asked, rather incredulously, "and the school are ok with that?".  Now, the swimming pool is hot, and I was sat with my baldy head out.  She clearly hadn't joined the dots.  I turned to look at her and said, "I'm having treatment for breast cancer.  We've had precious little quality time as a family since my diagnosis, and thankfully the school has agreed that these are exceptional circumstances."

To be honest I was a bit stunned by this exchange.  This woman was judging me for taking my kids out of school.  Believe me, it wasn't a decision that we took lightly, but the children have been under a lot of stress recently.  It manifests itself in a few different ways.  Tantrums, bed wetting, nightmares, etc.  Imogen and Felix deserve a few days away with their parents to make some magical memories before having more treatment.

I crashed on the sofa for the rest of the day.  I hope I have more energy for the holiday.

Today was spent watching rugby training, and then getting organised for holiday.  I can't wait.
