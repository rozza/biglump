In a moment of insanity, I agreed to join the team, along with Michelle, Charli, Rachel, Anna and James.  I haven't played netball in a long time, but as the aim was to raise money for Macmillan, I thought I'd give it a go.

Fast forward to yesterday morning.  We arrived, registered, paid our Â£5, got our bibs on and  before long we were actually playing.  It was fun.  I played Wing Attack, and once I remembered the rules, soon got into the swing of it.

We played 5 games, won one, drew one, lost the rest, but it didn't overly matter, we knew we weren't going to win.  

The event was being organised by the cousin of a lady who is currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer.  At a break in our games I went to talk to her.  As it turns out she has the same consultants as I do, although she see's them at a different hospital.  I haven't met anyone locally who is going through Breast Cancer and who is near to me in age.  I have met some wonderful ladies online (Big Up! November Newbies), some of whom are about my age, and I know relatives and friends who have been through this, but they tend to be older.  I don't wish this horrible disease on anyone, but it was nice to meet such a lovely lady, who seemed so positive and was even playing netball whilst in the middle of chemotherapy.  I don't think I would have been able to do it.  We had a good chat about what treatment we were both having, the consultants, etc. and also about wigs, hats and hair.  I wish her well with her treatment.

Once we finished playing I came home and pretty much vegged for the rest of the day.

I woke up this morning aching!  All over!  It hurts to walk, sit down, get up. Stairs?  Ouch!  I've had to take a couple of painkillers.  What a plonker.

Oh well, it's all helping me to get my fitness back.  I've got 4 weeks until the Standalone 10k run.  I've got a 5k in the bag and hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to get a short run in before a longer run on Thursday.  My prediction is that I'll be very near the back of the finishers, if not the last.  But do you know what?  Just finishing will be good enough.  Especially after the year I've had.  The race is nearly one year to the day I had the ultrasound, mammogram and biopsy which lead to my cancer diagnosis.

I may need some support on the day though, Ross will be with the bairns at their first rugby festival of the season.  He was supposed to be running with me, but he needs to support the bairns.  Any volunteers?
