Woot.  In fact, despite having cancer, all the various health checks I've had recently tell me I'm actually in pretty good shape.  This is good news.

So it's all go for the chemo and herceptin on Wednesday and Thursday.  I'm feeling quite calm about it.

As I was driving to work this this morning, David Guetta's Titanium came on.  "Shoot me down, but I won't fall, I am Titanium".  That's me!
