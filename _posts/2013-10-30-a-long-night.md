The CT Scan yesterday and the operation being moved to Monday has taken its toll.  This is now
real and Julia is scared.  What happens if the CT Scan shows something up?  Her
shoulder has been sore and it's hard not to correlate the two things. I tell her
we have to take things one day at a time, one step at a time and I'm with her
all the way.  We don't sleep well, I dose and when I awake, I rub her back
- it will be ok.

Imogen decides 6:40am is a good time to wake up and comes into the bedroom, telling
me she forgot to set her alarm.  She's worried she's slept in! I'm not too kind as
I tell her to get BACK to her room.  It's ok though, she gets her own back by deciding
now's a good time to do recorder practice.

The replacement tv cabinet arrives early, we get it set up and the kids scramble
about helping me hoover up the polystyrene bits so we can send a pic to mummy. It
looks great.  Then it's time for Felix to get his hair cut, the last time we went
to the new barbers I practically had to push him in there when he saw the barber
was a lady.  He's over it and practically jumps into the seat - he knows there's
a lollypop coming post hair cut.  I get my hair cut as well, a grade zero which
also saw a cut throat razor. It's hard not to gulp when one of those comes out!

Julia has had her CT Scan results all clear! F*ck yeah!

The old owners had a crate of wine delivered by accident - decisions, decisions...

The afternoon involves laundry, Jesus ironing sucks.  Roll on the tumble dryer,
as no t-shirt will need ironing again.  Our neighbour kindly takes the kids out
for a walk and I steam some creases. Rock and Roll.

Now cooking tea, drinking wine and looking forward to seeing the inlaws in Toon
tomorrow.
