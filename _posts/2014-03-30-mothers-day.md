I was presented with a tray full of cards, plants and a cup of coffee in bed by my wonderful bairns.  No less than 4 from Imogen!  I was allowed to stay in bed a little bit longer before I was told to get up to go to rugby training.

It was great watching them both run round in the sunshine.

Then it was home to get them bathed and Ross cooked a lovely roast dinner.

Felix helped me pack my case for hospital and we had lots of cuddles.  It's going to be hard for them this week with me being away.  Grandad will be holding the fort so that Ross can be with me.  We are lucky to have such support.
