Being diagnosed with Cancer at 36 years old is one of those things.  We'd just moved into our forever house, Ross was really enjoying work, I was working 4 days a weeks as a Software Development Team Leader and we were comfortable.  Things had started to be less of a struggle.  And then, Bam!, everything gets spun around and we, as are family, are left reeling and wondering which way is up.

I continued to work throughout the initial operations and Chemotherapy, mainly working from home.  Unfortunately this left me extremely fatigued and as a result my energy levels for spending with the bairns and Ross were depleted.  They weren't getting anything from me, nevermind the best of me.

After our break to Center Parcs, I had my big operation, and I haven't been back to work since.  I found I was still suffering with fatigue, and the Oncologist assured me that this was perfectly understandable after all the treatments I've been through.

In the May half term I was able to have some great days with the bairns and just enjoy being a Mummy.  Generally followed by a long nap.

My work had been going through a lot of changes as a result of a joint venture between two big European companies.  As a result of this there was some restructuring and I was given the opportunity to take Voluntary Redundancy.  Ross and I decided that it was something I should go for.  My priority needs to be my family.  

Luckily for me, my application was successful, and yesterday was officially my last day at work.  I have mixed feelings about it, I worked there for four years, and met some really interesting people.  I also learned a lot, and hopefully I'll be able to transfer that to any new job I get in the future.

Things are going to be tight for us until I start working again, but you can't put a price on being here, being with my family.  We'll manage.

I'll pop in and collect my photo's of the bairns once I've finished my radiotherapy and say goodbye to everyone properly.
