I love seeing the snowdrops, crocuses, daffodils and the blossom on the trees. Spring has always been my favourite time of year.  Full of possibilities, of opportunities, and lots of what can be’s. It’s a reminder that life goes on and it’s no different in the Lawley house.  We’ve got the usual round of school, music lessons, swimming lessons, rugby and dancing.  It’s almost as if we are a normal family!

And to add to the normality, I’ve started working again.  Its not much.  Only 10-15 hours a week, and I’m working at home, but it gets my brain working again.  It’s spent the last 8 months slowly turning to mush.  It’ll be good to get my teeth into something again.  Plus we need to refill the Lawley coffers that have taken a battering whilst I haven’t been working.  Boring, but necessary.

I’m also spending 2 hours a week in the local Library as their IT Champion.  I’m helping out the public who maybe aren’t so confident using computers.  It’s early days yet, and I haven’t had a massive uptake, but it’ll take time to get word out that I’m around.  In the meantime, I’m writing a blog post!

One of the things I said I would do last year when I was being a little bit fatalistic was that I would stop putting things off, and do the things that I wanted to do.  So far I’ve joined a choir, and will be performing in a concert in May, I’ve run another Standalone 10km, and the latest thing is that I’ve signed up to do a Race For Life Pretty Muddy in June.  It’s not as hard core as the Tough Mudder/Beach Warrior/One True Grit, etc, but given that I’ll only be one month past keyhole surgery it’s probably not a bad thing.  I’ve got a few of the Gin Club ladies to sign up too, so it should be a good laugh.

As I said, life goes on, and we are planning this years camping trips and summer holidays.  Something that this time last year, and to an extent this year until we got the surgery date, we felt we weren’t able to do.  Ross and I have decided that we’ll delay reconstruction  until September time.  Then we can have the kids back at school and I can get the long recovery time I need without interfering in our family time too much.

So, as is standard, we’ll keep on, keeping on.
