I've ordered a new washing machine and tumble dryer.  My existing washer is 9 years old and sounds like its going to take off when it spins.  That's not going to be very conducive to a relaxing recovery.  The tumble dryer will just make life easier.

I've also spoken to my wonderful hairdresser.  I've decided that there's no point having my hair coloured if its going to fall out and cancelled my appointments scheduled between now and Christmas. Instead I've made one for a couple of weeks time to have it cut short.  My reasoning is that when it falls out it doesn't come as such big change.  It'll also take less time to maintain and that's a good thing.

We went to a local fireworks display on Saturday night with our friends.  There was beer and company.  Good for us all.  The fireworks were fantastic and we all had a great time.

The clocks went back an hour this morning and thanks to a later than normal night, the bairns got up at a reasonable time.  I stayed in bed as long as I could.  I seem to be using sleep as a coping mechanism.  If I'm asleep I can't think about things, and there's some things I don't want to think about.   Unfortunately, I'm sleepwalking.  I've got form.  I do it in times of stress.  Hmm.

I watched my little fish at their swimming lessons.  Felix has come on so well in the last few weeks.  He can now swim a whole 25m length on his own.  And Imogen is amazing.  I just wish she'd listen to the teacher so she can improve her technique.

Then this afternoon, I slept on the sofa whilst family life continued around me.

Ross is being fantastic.  He's picking up the slack already.

Back to work tomorrow.  During the Storm of St Jude, patron saint of lost causes.  The two are not connected.
