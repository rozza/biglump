Trying to avoid the public displays of affection from the two youngsters sat opposite me in a very small waiting room, and a drip which  made me feel hot, which was just as well as the room's air con seemed to be set to cold gale.  Not pleasant when you're wearing a hospital gown.

 I had a joke with the radiographers which lightened the mood somewhat.  I seem to have a habit of trying to lighten things up.  Is it my job to do that?  Probably not, but if I don't then who will?  Do people think I'm going to cry or talk about cancer all the time?  I don't know, but I haven't changed my personality.   I can still be a cow, granted, but that's normal!

We had a long conversation with the health insurance company, which resulted in a conversation with my Consultant, and the first operation potentially being brought forward to Monday.  This Monday.  After the weekend Monday.  6 days time Monday.  (When I was supposed to be getting the new washing machine delivered.  That's now been changed.)

This scares me.  It means that I really am on this journey.  It's not a dream, and it is happening to me.  Sometimes it feels like this is all happening to someone else.     Having an operation means it is happening.

So, I'm having a glass of wine.
