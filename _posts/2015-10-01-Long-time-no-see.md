It's been five months since my last post, and a lot has happened but I'll try to be brief!

At the beginning of May, I had the key hole surgery to remove the cyst on my ovary.  It turns out that there was in fact two cysts, of different types, but both completely benign.  They were both removed successfully along with the offending ovary.  The surgeon was happy with the outcome and has decided he doesn't need to see me again.  Good news!

Four weeks after this surgery, I completed the Pretty Muddy Race For Life with Allison, Caroline, Charli and Michelle.  It was great fun, and we were all suitably grubby when we'd finished.  The supporting squad were very much appreciated.

In July, a larger Gin Club contingent took part in the Stevenage Race for Life, followed by a post race fundraising BBQ at The Orange Tree.  Thanks Rob!  We managed to raise over Â£1000 for Cancer Research.

August brought us school holidays and our two week family break away.  The first week we went to the Peak District with my Dad ad Julie and had some great days out.  The second week we went to the Lake District and marched up and down hills most days, but also ventured over the Hardknott and Wrynose Pass which was an interesting drive!

Back to school in September and the kids settled back into their new classes well.

Back in January, I'd mentioned to my good friend Fiona, that I fancied doing a Trialthlon.  "I'll do it with you" she said.  Well, she did do it, and I didn't.  I didn't know when the reconstruction surgery was going to be, so I thought it best not to commit to such a big thing.  I now owe her a triathlon.  She was amazing.  It was a hot day and a hard course, but she did it.  And with a smile on her face (not all the time, there might have been swearing at times, but we can forgive her that.)

And that brings us to New Boob Day!
