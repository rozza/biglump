Julia is downstairs putting some code live, she can't sleep and said she'd do it
yesterday when the world was normal.  If you can't sleep its good to focus on
something.

We told the kids before school, both Julia and I choked back tears when reading
"Mummy's Lump" - a book about breast cancer given to us yesterday.  How did it
come to this?  I found it achingly difficult, so we went over it again.  We told
Imogen & Felix to make sure they don't bottle it up. Imogen seems to understand but
Felix is a different matter, he wanted to know more about the lump and wanted to
feel it.

We took the kids in late to school and spoke to the head mistress.  She was great
and understanding of the situation.  The kids will get a card to hold up if they
ever need time out.  No questions will be asked they can go and sit with the head
mistress and chill.  This is an enormous comfort and its good to know the kids are
in safe hands.

I call my mum up again are a text from dad, saying he's thinking of us and
struggling to get his head round the news.  Its good talking to mum, she's still
in shock but is being pragmatic and asking questions about the treatment. This time
I cry as I express my fears.  The biggest being I'm worried I won't live up to
expectations and be strong enough for Julia.  Today has been a really leaky day
for my eyes!  And emotions are still so strong and raw - it's a lot to take in.

I email the gin club dads telling them about the news and
that I will need help, support, beers and sometimes to escape the insanity of the
family in the coming days.

Julia has a nap and I head off to parents evening. Its good to focus on the kids
and they are both doing well.  Imogen is having her normal first half term of the
year issues - some alpha positioning thing with the teacher and class mates.  The
teacher loves her passion and there are a few things to work on but on the whole
shes settling in this year great.  I think the teacher was shocked when Imogen did
a "My Mums got Breast Cancer" talk for show and tell!  *Well we did say don't
bottle it in!*  Felix's review was *awesome*, he's such a
lovely boy and the teachers are really impressed with him and his progress.
Julia and I are lucky to have such fantastic kids.

In the evening, I start to feel more lucid and actually myself.  Julia and I
chill watching rot on the TV and it feels closer to normal.  All our close
friends and family know and I plan on setting up a blog tomorrow to help get these
feelings out.
