Yesterday Felix had a few friends round to run around, have Nerf gun battles, and eat pizza.  Imogen got stuck in too, and a good time was had by all.

Today is his birthday.  Ross and I had to wrap the birthday presents that were contained in a number of Amazon boxes.  We'd left pretty much everything until the last minute.  But luckily, we pulled it off and we got it all done on time.

Felix was very pleased with his presents including "Exploding Kittens" which I had been a bit dubious about.

Birthday Tea was a curry at the Lancer.  Everyone was a winner with that one.

Happy Birthday to my Beautiful Boy.   Love you to the Moon and Back.
