He's told me I'm not allowed to just sit on the sofa all day and watch daytime tv.  (Meanie).

So, I've been using Ross's Fitbit and trying to get 10,000 steps in a day. This works out at about 7km or 4.5 miles a day. Some days it's fine, as I can pretty much do that by walking the kids to and from school.  Other days it's a bit harder.  Like at the weekends.  I've come to realise that I don't move very much at the weekends.  

Thankfully, a friend, (that's you Fiona), has challenged me to a step race.  It's basically who can get the most steps in Monday to Friday.  My competitive streak kicked in, and I managed to win last week.  I came last in the weekend challenge, (lol), but I'm on track this week and managed my 10,000 steps before 10:10am this morning after a brisk walk round Baldock.

I've just checked my stats for the past 7 days, and I've walked nearly 50km which is just over 31 miles.  That's got to be doing something for my fitness levels surely!

If you see me walking round Baldock purposefully, you know why.
