Ross went to Dublin on Monday 2nd Feb, and at lunchtime my Dad arrived to steer the Lawley ship in his absence.  He did a super job of making sure the kids, cats and I  were fed and watered, the bairns got to and from school and after school groups on time, and kept the litter tray tidy.  He also found time to do a few DIY jobs round the house and garden.  I was chauffeured to my hospital appointments and he sat with me when I had my chemo.  I wasn't much company, as soon as they give me the Piriton, I fell asleep.

On Wednesday, Ross hopped over the Atlantic to New York for a couple of days, and late Friday I had word he was on his way home.  He arrived back to us just as Dad was taking the bairns to their swimming lesson on Saturday morning.  I was sad when Dad left on Saturday afternoon, but realise Julie needs him too!

I am so lucky to have two utterly dependable men in my life.  Thank you Dad, thank you Ross.  (And thank you Julie for letting me borrow him for a short while.)
