After a few hours the kids came in and were despatched to play on the Playstation or read.  Next thing I know, it's time for Ross to take Felix to his swimming lesson and Imogen was instructed to get her homework done.

Once we'd had lunch it was time to see Star Wars again.  This time at the IMAX.  It was brilliant.  We really enjoyed it.  It was quite uncomfortable for me to sit for over two hours and I was glad to get home to top up the painkillers.

A curry was ordered in for tea, and Ross went out for a couple of beers.  I went to bed when the kids did.

On Sunday we were praying that rugby training would be cancelled due to it being so cold and a covering of snow.  Luckily it was, so despite my early waking, I had Breakfast in bed and was back asleep by 10am.

The rest of the day was quiet, but with the anticipation building for tomorrow's final scan and the results we'll get, to say I'm a bit anxious is an understatement.
