I was adamant I wasn't going to be in the Igloo for my birthday.  In the end, I didn't really have a choice.  My pain wasn't under control, and I was regularly having to top up what they were giving me. I had been to the Spire in Harpenden the day before to start my Herceptin and Zometra treatment, and on the afternoon I hoped to be sent home, I spent asleep fatigued from the excursion.

The plan had been for me to go out for a Birthday Cream Tea at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeaatTapps/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Tea at Tapps</a>.   I've been there a few times and am always impressed with their wonderful range of teas, coffees, and cakes.  Ross picked me up from the Igloo and took me to meet the bairns and Grandma and Grandad to have out birthday cream tea.  It was delicious.  My only grumble is that the scones aren't big enough, but that's the steroids talking...I'm sure they are the perfect size for a normal person!

I felt very lucky, and overwhelmed with the amount of cards and presents I received.    After a wander around the gift shop and garden centre, I was sent back to the Igloo with strict instructions to sleep as Ross and I were going out that night for a meal.

Ross collected me from the Igloo,  all dressed up and ready to go, and then after dropping the car off at home, my Dad took us to <a href="http://www.thegeorgeatbaldock.co.uk/" target="_blank">The George</a>  for a fine dining spectacular.  I enjoyed being out with Ross, spending some quality time with him in a non- medical setting.  However, I quickly started to feel very fatigued, so much so we didn't manage a pudding.  You know things are serious when I can't manage a pudding!
The starter and main meal were delicious and all in all we were out for about an hour, but it was a good hour, I enjoyed it.  Enjoyed being a normal couple with my husband.
