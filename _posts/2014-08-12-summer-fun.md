As I'm not working I get to spend the whole of the summer holidays with the bairns.  

So far we've been on walks, bike rides, runs, to the park and spent a lot of time making loom band bracelets, charms and characters.

I'm very lucky to be able to have this time with them and even when they are bickering, and I'm finding them annoying, I am enjoying this time.

The highlight so far has been our Willow Foundation Special Day.  Willow is a charity which gives seriously ill people between 16-40 the chance to make some memories and forget about illness and treatment.  We went to London for the day on Sunday.  We went on the London Eye, saw Matilda the musical, and had dinner in the Rainforest Cafe.  It was fantastic.  We have all been caught singing the songs and certainly have some nice things to think about.

We have also spent three nights camping with friends.  The weekend we chose was the one that ex-hurricane Bertha hit, and although we did get a bit damp and soggy on the Sunday morning, we dried up in a local pub and fortified ourselves with a very fine roast dinner.

Next week we'll be heading up to Newcastle to visit my family.  I'm hoping to catch up with some old friends.
