  <content type="html">Hi, its been ages - 4 months and 20 something days since my last post!&lt;p&gt;So I probably should write something down, so when I look back and reflect in years to come I will have some thoughts of my own to read also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer has been good, Julia’s radiotherapy came and went in a busy, busy month. Julia got very fatigued and then started to get better and then fatigued again.  The gin club turned out on mass for the race for life and it was a great event, the post run drinks were also highly amusing and liver pickling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lost Merlin or rather Merlin lost himself somewhere, god only knows what happened to him. I looked like a local lunatic for weeks when I went walking around the neighbourhood whistling and shouting out: &lt;br /&gt;“♪ ♫ ♩Here kitty, kitty, kitty! ♪ ♫ ♩ Merlin ♭♫”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few sightings were had but he is still awol.  Maybe he really was the cancer cat and as soon as he knew Julia was ok he buggered off to help someone else.  I hope where ever he is he’s happy, he brightened up a dark year for us Lawleys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herceptin is ongoing for Julia but only two more to go!  For over a year the chemicals have been pumped into Mrs L and it’s now noticable that it’s taking longer to recover.  There’s barely time to bounce back and then the three weeks are up and it’s back for some more.  It seems to be more of a frustration to Julia as it’s not the crippling fatigue of Chemotherapy just a slow trudge up a big hill.  Still the end is in sight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holiday wise, we a couple of great camping trips - one seeing the tail of hurricane Bertha trying to blow down our tents!  We had a fabulous day out thanks to the Willow foundation - it really was magical.  We went to Newcastle and to the races!  I managed to put a bet on a horse that the jockey fell off before even starting the race! The shame they must have felt as they had to run with the horse to the start line and then only to be bucked off as soon as the gates opened.  During autumn half term we went to the peak district - and walked the legs off the kids. They were brilliant and hardly complained, the weather, like the hills was fantastic. Google maps took us down some of the smallest lanes, I’ve ever seen and I was cursing under my breath when a car came up the hill meaning I had to reverse until we reached a passing point. I really showed my skills by reversing and zigzagging across the small lane. As soon as we came back from the peaks (within hours) we got a new kitten, Mundungus, he’s a cheaky chappie and causing mischief like only kittens can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids are loving sport and music. Imogen rocked the duck n dash and is getting stuck in at rugby - 5 tries in the last game! Felix is coming on leaps and bounds in rugby also, he has grown a hunger for tags and tries. Their smiles after a game, warm the coldest of days and they’ve played on some of them.  Their swimming is coming on, Felix has sorted out his legs and moved up a cap after being parked for a while, it looks like progression out of this one will be quick.  Imogen’s gymnastics is coming on leaps and bounds (pun intended).  Julia and I resorted to blackmail to get Felix to sign up to the choir and learning ocarina - it paid off and he’s loving it. Imogen bought a flute (with her own savings!) her learning of music and skills have blown me away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not all gravy though, the years events have taken their toll on me. The stress flared up my already bad stomach acid.  I finally went to the doctors who give me some great tummy tablets, which has stopped it in it’s tracks - totally life changing. However, I had to endure and endoscopy, which even with the sedative wasn’t the most pleasant experience.  I thought I came out quite well - I have a small hernia which helps explain the reflux.  Today, I got a letter today out the blue telling me I have a condition called Barretts Oesophagus.  Seems years of reflux has left its mark - that’ll teach me for not getting the doctors to sort it sooner. Apart from being a little freaked, mainly because googling it took me straight to the Macmillan website, I’m not sure what the ramifications are and time will tell, if its sinister or not - I’ll leave those things I can’t control aside until I get referred and find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing can stop the excitement mounting in the Lawley household! The advent calendars are emptying of chocolate at what feels like a speeded up rate.  I loved last years Christmas as it was the first one in the new house and the first one at home for us Lawleys.  This year I even get Julia to help! and I’m much looking forward to cementing tradition with a Christmas day pint down the Orange Tree.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">It&#39;s been quite odd to think that this time last year I was preparing for a course of events which would have such far reaching implications.&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t to know that my body wouldn’t be able to deal with the toxicity of the chemotherapy regime that had been selected for me, and that instead I’d have to have the infusions every week which would leave me with so little energy I would become a shadow of my former self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t to know that my hair would fall out over a period of weeks.  I had thought it would happen straight away.  I also wasn’t prepared for the uncomfortable wigs.  In the end, I just wore cotton hats, or wooly ones when I was outside, no one really knew on the school run that I was bald.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t to know that I would be told that I had a genetic abnormality which meant that my risks of getting breast cancer were increased from 1 in 10, to between 1 in 4 and 1 in 2.  At least with this information we were able to make informed decisions about further surgery, and resulted in having a risk reducing mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t to know how wonderful Ross would be.  He stepped up to pretty much do everything associated with TeamRJ whilst my energy levels dropped to all time lows.  I know he found it tough at times, but he was always able to call on the Gin Club Dad’s to go for a cheeky pint and bend someone’s ear.  Or just talk about normal things.  Normal is so underated.  Love you. x&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t to know how brilliantly the Bairns would deal with everything.  Despite having the rug pulled from under them, they have been fantastic.  Imogen and Felix got star reports at the end of the school year, and have settled into the new school year well.  I have always been a believer in that things are only scary if you don’t understand them.  They knew I went to hospital every Friday for Chemo and come home and go to sleep.  This worried them.  So, they came with me a few times.  They saw what happened, a small needle inserted into my port and then bags of what looked like water dripped in.  No big deal.  No longer scary.  They skyped me when I was in hospital after I’d had my surgery, and they came to see me when I was feeling up to it.  They make me so proud and I love them so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t to know a lot of things, and to be honest, some of them, I might have been happy not to know.  But I’m here, I’m ok and that’s what counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of 1 year anniversary’s happening over the next few weeks.  1 year since I had my port implanted, 1 year since I had my first chemotherapy and herceptin, 1 year since I was in A&amp;amp;E with horrific chest pains caused by the chemotherapy, the list goes on.  Anyone who has spent any time with me over the past year will know that it hasn’t been plain sailing, it hasn’t been a walk in the park, but neither has it been all completely horrific.  There’s been good times along the way, and to each of you who has supported us, I offer my heartfelt thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">A post all of it&#39;s own, because they deserve it.&lt;p&gt;I started Chemo in November last year and stumbled upon the Breast Cancer Care forum.  There was a thread where any ladies who started Chemo in November 2013 could chat about side effects, surgery, wigs or just general cancer or non-cancer related things. Through this forum, I was invited to join a Facebook group where we could discuss things privately. At times discussing things that we felt we couldn’t share with anyone else, because no one else could understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how amazing these women are.  Each on their own rather crappy journey, but each and every one of them giving and receiving support when it’s been needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some had surgery before chemo, some after, some had Herceptin, some had rads, no two journey’s are the same. But we were all there, at the end of a computer, sometimes in the middle of the night, helping one another through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, we lost one of our NN’s, Rachel.  She was one of a kind, only 42 with two beautiful children.  She had a wicked sense of humour and told us some hilarious stories.  The whole group is devastated.  We all knew the statistics, and despite the fact we’d all been on the wrong side of a cancer diagnosis, some of which happened at a very young age, this wasn’t supposed to happen. This wasn’t in the script. I’m on the road to recovery, I expect all the November Newbies to be so too.  Unfortunately, this isn’t the case, and it sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rachel, we miss you.  Fly high with laughter on your wings.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">So, here we on on my 1 year Cancerversary.&lt;p&gt;One year since hearing those words that have turned my life upside down. “It’s Cancer.”  The disbelief, how can this happen to me? I was only 36, with a husband and two bairns who needed me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that year, I’ve had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A port implanted to allow for easier administration of drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 lots of surgery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 genetics consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;24 appointments with Consultants.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11 CT/MRI/ECG scans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At least 10 blood tests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 doses of chemotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;14 doses of Herceptin, (4 to go!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15 radiotherapy sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 trip to A&amp;amp;E with chest pains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;275+ daily Tamoxifen tablets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve lost my hair, and it’s growing back curly!&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve spent a lot of time in bed as I’ve struggled with fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve walked the Race for Life 5k with the Gin Club, and together we raised over £2800 for Cancer Research.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve completed the Standalone 10k road race with Michelle.&lt;br /&gt;
We’ve had a wonderful family holiday to Center Parcs.&lt;br /&gt;
We’ve been on a really special day out to London courtesy of the Willow Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve left my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general friends and family, old and new, real life and internet weirdies have been amazing. The support we’ve received has ranged from babysitting and providing meals to hugs, flowers, and just well timed messages. I’m not going to dwell on those that have let us down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I will be celebrating with the Gin Club, and looking forward to getting through the next few months which will bring the end of active treatment, and hopefully reconstruction surgery. I’m still here, albeit not quite in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over half term we are going on holiday with my Dad and Julie, and we get to be a normal family. (Even though we’ve never been a normal family!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who has been on this journey with us so far. It’s been a marathon, but we’ll get there. And I’ll just keep on, keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">The Gin Club decided to field a team in a local netball tournament.&lt;p&gt;In a moment of insanity, I agreed to join the team, along with Michelle, Charli, Rachel, Anna and James.  I haven’t played netball in a long time, but as the aim was to raise money for Macmillan, I thought I’d give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to yesterday morning.  We arrived, registered, paid our £5, got our bibs on and  before long we were actually playing.  It was fun.  I played Wing Attack, and once I remembered the rules, soon got into the swing of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We played 5 games, won one, drew one, lost the rest, but it didn’t overly matter, we knew we weren’t going to win.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was being organised by the cousin of a lady who is currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer.  At a break in our games I went to talk to her.  As it turns out she has the same consultants as I do, although she see’s them at a different hospital.  I haven’t met anyone locally who is going through Breast Cancer and who is near to me in age.  I have met some wonderful ladies online (Big Up! November Newbies), some of whom are about my age, and I know relatives and friends who have been through this, but they tend to be older.  I don’t wish this horrible disease on anyone, but it was nice to meet such a lovely lady, who seemed so positive and was even playing netball whilst in the middle of chemotherapy.  I don’t think I would have been able to do it.  We had a good chat about what treatment we were both having, the consultants, etc. and also about wigs, hats and hair.  I wish her well with her treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we finished playing I came home and pretty much vegged for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning aching!  All over!  It hurts to walk, sit down, get up. Stairs?  Ouch!  I’ve had to take a couple of painkillers.  What a plonker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, it’s all helping me to get my fitness back.  I’ve got 4 weeks until the Standalone 10k run.  I’ve got a 5k in the bag and hopefully tomorrow I’ll be able to get a short run in before a longer run on Thursday.  My prediction is that I’ll be very near the back of the finishers, if not the last.  But do you know what?  Just finishing will be good enough.  Especially after the year I’ve had.  The race is nearly one year to the day I had the ultrasound, mammogram and biopsy which lead to my cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may need some support on the day though, Ross will be with the bairns at their first rugby festival of the season.  He was supposed to be running with me, but he needs to support the bairns.  Any volunteers?&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">All too soon, the holidays are over and it&#39;s back to school.&lt;p&gt;I’m probably in the minority here, but I don’t think the holidays were long enough.  Just as we got into the swing of things, it was time for them to go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, they are very excited about this.  Felix is looking forward to playing with his friends again, and Imogen is looking forward to learning to play the flute.  I am going to have to find myself things to do during the day whilst they aren’t here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross is going to have to come with my to my appointments again.  The bairns came with me the last couple of times I had Herceptin.  It’s quite nice to sit in a room with them and listen to them chatter on.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">As the final days of the summer holidays pass, Imogen makes the most of it.&lt;p&gt;One thing that helps us maintain the facade of being a ‘normal’ family, is having things to focus on.  Back in May, Ross decided to sign Imogen up for a Aquathlon called the Duck N Dash.  It’s organised by a local Triathlon club, and involves a swim in the outdoor pool and then a run round the common.  Ross has done the adult version before, and given how active Imogen is, thought she’d enjoy it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Imogen, she picked up an ear infection and perforated ear drum in June which meant she was unable to swim.  She missed weeks of swimming lessons and wasn’t even allowed to get her ear wet when she washed her hair.  Finally on the 14th August, she was given the all clear to swim again.  Her ear had healed, the infection was gone, and she was good to go!  Then another spanner in the works, rugby training started on the same day!  She’s moving into the Under 9 age group which involves contact and tackling.  She’s the only girl on the team, so we wanted to make sure she was there at the very start of the season so she could get the most out of the training sessions so she was confident enough to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, due to the lack of swimming, and because of rugby, we decided she wasn’t going to do it.  She was a bit disappointed, but understood why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday evening, Ross got an email with the start times.  Because everyone has their own individual start time, Imogen was due to start at 9:02am.  She had to swim one length of a 50m pool, and then do a 600m run.  I know how fast she can swim, and I know how fast she can run 600m as we’d practiced that distance during the holidays, so reckoned she’d be finished by 9:15am and have enough time to get changed and to rugby for the start of training.  It was all back on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday afternoon, Ross and Imogen went to the outdoor pool to register, pick up her number, her chip she had to wear around her ankle and have the number ‘13’ written in permanent marker on her arm and leg.  The people from Freedom Tri were on hand to give her some information on the transition and also where she’d have to run.  This was really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening she practiced putting her shoes and socks on quickly and got herself prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning, we were up early and all had a fortifying breakfast.  The sun was shining, it was a beautiful day for it.  We got there early and Imogen went to set up her transition gear.  I realised at this point, we’d forgotten her goggles!  Panic!  A quick dash home to collect them and she was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/duckndash_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Getting In The Zone&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 9:00am, the first competitor started, Imogen’s friend Freddie from school.  Also taking part was Jenson from the Gin Club, and Daniel from her rugby squad.  There were 16 in total in her age group.  They all looked really confident, and it was great to see them competing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 9:02am, she was in and got off to a great start.  She overtook a couple on the swim and was out and putting her shoes and t-shirt on before I knew it.  I have to admit to being a bit shouty at this point.  Anyone who knows me, will tell you that I can be quite loud.  I think I drew a few funny looks as I stood on the opposite side of the pool, shouting like a Fish Wife “Hurry up Imogen!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She ran out the pool onto the common where Ross was waiting to cheer her on.  I raced round and got to the end just in time to see her cross the line.  I was so proud.  She did so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We waited for Daniel and Jenson to cross the line so we could cheer them on, and then raced to get changed and off to rugby.  We didn’t hang around to find out her time, its the old saying, it’s the taking part that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rugby training went really well for both Imogen and Felix.  Felix slotted straight back in with his friends and spent an hour and a half running around, chasing balls, and having fun.  Imogen listened carefully to her coaches as the started giving instructions on how to tackle safely and confidently.  They both got registered for the new season and wore their new Letchworth Rugby Club t-shirts with pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once training was over we had to go back to the outdoor pool to collect Imogen’s towel and goggles.  We still didn’t know what time she’d done it in, and couldn’t find anyone to ask, so we just went home, and Imogen went to Katy’s pamper party for a bit of girly time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all went to bed exhausted that night, and I’d just dropped off when Ross’s phone beeped with an email telling us the times had been published.  We had a quick look and were delighted to find Imogen had won her category!  Girls Under 8 Duck N Dash champion.  We were so proud.  She did it in 6 minutes and 6 seconds!  What a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/duckndash2_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Champion&quot; /&gt;

  <content type="html">Merlin has gone missing.&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Merlin went out in the afternoon, and that was the last we’ve seen of him.  We are devastated.  We got him to take distract me whilst I waited between tests and results and then further down the road, treatment.  It worked.  He was such a wonderful, friendly, sparky cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have leafletted, put posters up and rang round all the vets, but no one has seen him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We miss him so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/merlin2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Merlin&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving a Cat Sitter in charge of Meg and Mog, and instructions to let us know if Merlin turned up, we spent a week in Tynemouth with my family enjoying the last of the school holidays.  We had a great time, I managed a couple of runs, lots of walks and we also did plenty paddling in the sea.  Ross seemed to forgot that Tynemouth was beside the North Sea, and decided to take the bairns swimming in Cullercoats Bay.  It was very cold, but they really enjoyed it.  (Crazy people.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We caught up with all the important people we haven’t seen since I was last up just after my diagnosis.  It’s interesting how different people react and deal with my diagnosis in different ways.  For example, some people will ask how my treatment is going, how I’m feeling, what the next step is, etc.  Whilst others just ignore it completely.  I know it’s difficult, but it just goes to show that there is no right and wrong in how anyone deals with things.  Everyone just does the best they can to get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were hoping to have Merlin home by the time we got back, but sadly not.  Where are you Merlin?&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">The summer holidays have arrived and we are having fun!&lt;p&gt;As I’m not working I get to spend the whole of the summer holidays with the bairns.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve been on walks, bike rides, runs, to the park and spent a lot of time making loom band bracelets, charms and characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very lucky to be able to have this time with them and even when they are bickering, and I’m finding them annoying, I am enjoying this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight so far has been our Willow Foundation Special Day.  Willow is a charity which gives seriously ill people between 16-40 the chance to make some memories and forget about illness and treatment.  We went to London for the day on Sunday.  We went on the London Eye, saw Matilda the musical, and had dinner in the Rainforest Cafe.  It was fantastic.  We have all been caught singing the songs and certainly have some nice things to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also spent three nights camping with friends.  The weekend we chose was the one that ex-hurricane Bertha hit, and although we did get a bit damp and soggy on the Sunday morning, we dried up in a local pub and fortified ourselves with a very fine roast dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week we’ll be heading up to Newcastle to visit my family.  I’m hoping to catch up with some old friends.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I&#39;m still having Herceptin every 3 weeks.&lt;p&gt;I need to have 18 treatments in total, so I won’t be finished until early January.  The side effects are minimal, although they do leave me fatigued.  No where near Chemo-fatigued, but tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I saw the surgeon, he suggested going to see the Plastic Surgeon to discuss my reconstruction options and timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is the operation can be done, the bad news is I have to wait until 6 months after radiotherapy has finished to give the skin a chance to recover.  I’ve been lucky with my skins reaction to radiotherapy, and apart from a square of slightly darker pigmentation, there are no outward signs of it. So, this takes us to the end of December.  Obviously I won’t want to have such a big operation at Christmas time, so it can wait until the new year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is Herceptin.  Studies have shown that whilst it is very effective in treating the HER+ type of cancer I have, it can cause cardiac problems.  A general anaesthetic puts quite a lot of stress on the body, so that coupled with a potential reduction in heart function also needs to be taken into account. I have regular heart scans to check everything is working as it should and so far there haven’t been any issues.  Taking all this into account, I might as well wait until I’ve finished the Herceptin before I have the reconstruction operation.  So that’ll be January.  I had hoped that I would be finished by then, but sadly not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ll keep on, keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">After months of planning, Sunday finally came around and it was Race Day!&lt;p&gt;Sixteen ladies and twelve children ran or walked the 5km course round Stevenage Fairlands Valley Park as part of The Gin Club Team. When I was diagnosed in October last year, it was one of the first things I asked the Breast Care Nurse.  She wasn’t very committal, and said it depend where I was in my treatment.  If I’d have had the planned FEC chemo in May/June, there was very little chance that I would have been able to participate, or if I did it was may have been in a wheelchair.  As it happened the Paclitaxel chemotherapy and the biological treatment Herceptin worked so well that there was no need for the extra chemo, and I was delighted to be able to take part.  This year it was personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GinClubRaceforLife2014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post Race picture&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wouldn’t be able to run it, my energy levels are still massively diminished, but Imogen and Felix were keen to do so.  Luckily, Catherine agreed to Felix running with her and James, and Michelle had Imogen running with her and Katy.  They both did so well and I am so proud of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were walking around, we decided that we’d all do it again next year, and more of us would run. We also may get customised t-shirts!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support was fantastic, not least my Dad, the Gin Club Dad’s and Matthew, Sarah, Eddie and Betty who had travelled up from Kent to cheer us on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was very emotional, especially when all the runners waited near the finish line so that they could all cross it with me.  I cried.  A lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t have been luckier with the weather either, and it only started raining once we’d all finished and were heading back to the cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/LawleyRFL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lawley&#39;s&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Post Race celebrations took place at The Orange Tree in Baldock.  A BBQ was organised and thanks to Landlord Rob, we raised another £200, bringing our total amount to £2,355.00.  An amazing amount of money for Cancer Research to do something truly magnificent, (I think there’s more to come too!).  I am proud and humbled to know that my friends did this for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment train still continues and today I am off to get another dose of Herceptin.  Ross will be with me, keeping me company, as is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all who have donated and supported us throughout this whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Last Friday I completed 15 daily sessions of Radiotherapy, and then went camping for the weekend.&lt;p&gt;The actual treatment itself wasn’t too bad, especially once I got on top of the whole breath holding technique.  The tediousness came from having to tip off down to Elstree everyday.  A boring journey in the back of a taxi.  I did see quite a lot of Red Kites, buzzards and kestrals though, which helped pass the time somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The side effects will continue for another 2 weeks when they peak, and then I should start to get some energy back.  It’s nowhere near as draining as chemo but still leaves me quite tired and unable to do as much as I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so glad that it’s over now, I feel like it’s the end of another leg in this epic cancer journey we are on.  In December/January, I’ll finish the 18 Herceptin treatments that I have every 3 weeks, and that’ll be the end of active treatment. That’s over a year after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being absolutely shattered after Friday’s treatment, I decided I was well enough to go camping.  I didn’t have to do much, Ross put the tent up with a bit of anti-help from the kids, and I entertained Joni, Greg and Rachel’s gorgeous smiley baby.  I then stayed around the camp and enjoyed some really good Gin Club company.  There’s a few changes that have to be made though, for next time.  I’ve realised I can’t sleep on our lovely space saving camping mattress.  I’m going to have to revert to the old faithful airbed.  I’m also going to have to have a proper pillow.  The scars and the swelling from the surgery make it just too uncomfortable so I need some extra padding.  But the next camping trip can’t come soon enough.  I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, Felix has lost his first two teeth!  We also got to test the Tooth Fairy, and she does indeed visit campsites.  My boy is growing up so fast.  I’ve just realised that I haven’t mentioned on the blog that he turned 6 at the end of May.  He had a fabulous birthday and really enjoyed having some friends come round and basically run riot for 2 hours.  Five boys were collected by their parents sweaty and happy…Good times!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen has got her birthday next week.  She is looking forward to going bowling with her friends followed by a McDonalds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross and I have got some new bikes so we can go out with the bairns when they are on theirs.  We’ve realised that Imogen needs a new bike so Felix can have hers.  Felix really needs a bike with gears.  They are enjoying having some days where they cycle to and from school and as a side plus point, it’s improving my stamina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it continues…keeping on, keeping on.  Trying to keep things normal as best we can and I think we are doing ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I worry that this blog must be a bit dull when I&#39;m just writing about what I&#39;ve been up to.&lt;p&gt;So I thought I’d write one from a different angle about why I’m lucky.  I know that sounds a bit daft, I mean, getting cancer at 36 is hardly fortuitous, but I have so many reasons to be thankful.  And here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-of-cancer&quot;&gt;Type of Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently there was an advertising campaign run by Pancreatic Cancer Action which introduced us to people who had been diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer and their wish that they had been diagnosed with another type of cancer.  The campaign was slated in the papers with outcries that you can’t pitch one type of cancer against another.  It was a bitter pill to swallow, but I can understand why these people feel like this.  Pancreatic Cancer has a 3% survival rate to 5 years&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  For Breast Cancer it’s over 80%, and that’s increased from 50% 40 years ago&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Those figures speak for themselves so, yes, I’m lucky that I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-of-cancer&quot;&gt;Stage of Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 5 Stages of Breast Cancer.  I’ve simplified it a bit, as I’m not 100% on it all, but it’s a summary of information from Cancer Research website&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tis - which is a very early stage of Cancer which is contained within the ducts of the breast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;T1 - The lumps (tumours) are less than 2cm across.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;T2 - More than 2cm but less than 5cm across.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;T3 - Bigger than 5cm across.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;T4 - The Cancer has spread from the breast into skin, or chest or elsewhere.  Most likely terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have Stage 2.  My tumours had a mass of 8cm with the biggest one not being bigger than 5cm across.  That’s still quite big in my book, but I’m pleased to remain at Stage 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;n1-m0&quot;&gt;N1, M0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The N and M Stages tell you whether the cancer has spread to the nodes or elsewhere. Again more information can be found on the Cancer Research website for this&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but in my case, N1, the cancer had spread into the Lymph Glands but hadn’t gone into the surrounding tissue.  My M stage was M0.  It hadn’t gone anywhere else, it was contained within the breast tissue and lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grade-3&quot;&gt;Grade 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bit isn’t such a lucky part.  Breast Cancer is graded 1-3 with one being where the cancer cells look most like normal cells&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Grade 3 cells are massively different, grow fast and are more likely to spread.  The lucky part is that the specialists know what to do about a Grade 3 cancer and what Chemotherapy and other drugs will work to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;er&quot;&gt;ER+&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I had to sign a consent form on this journey, was so they could do a biopsy to establish what the pathology of the tumours were.  This would then give the specialists the information they needed to plan my treatment.  It came back as ER+.  This meant that my oestrogen hormones were feeding the lumps as they were oestrogen receptive&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Luckily, they are able to block those receptors with a drug called Tamoxifen and halt the cancer.  I’ll be taking this for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;her2&quot;&gt;HER2+&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing they learned from the pathology was that I’m HER2+.  This means that the cancer cells have a higher than normal level of the HER2 protein which causes it to grow&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Between 1 in 4, and 1 in 5 of breast cancer cases are HER2+&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, in recent years, a drug called Herceptin has become more readily available.  It used to be a postcode lottery as to whether the local NHS authority would allow it&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but because it works so well, that is no longer the case.  Herceptin works by blocking the HER2 protein receptors telling the cancer cells to stop growing.  I have Herceptin via a drip infusion every 3 weeks over a year.  I had a gap for the surgery, but I’m on course to finish in October/November time - one year after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chek2&quot;&gt;CHEK2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My young age at diagnosis made us question how this could happen.  There is no family history apart from a distant cousin, so we were confused.  Was I a freak of nature, or a genetic freak?  When the Oncologist brought up the idea of genetic testing we thought it would give us answers to some of these questions.  And it did to an extent.  We expected to be told that I had an abnormality in the BRCA1/2 gene, which is the gene that increases the risk of breast cancer the most.  But I don’t. (See, lucky!)  On the NHS this would have been the only abnormality they check for.  However, as we had the test done privately, a whole range of other genes were tested which they know can have links to breast and other types of cancer.  This brought back a problem with the CHEK2 gene which increases chances of breast cancer occurring two or three times&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Obviously, I already have a Breast Cancer diagnosis, so this faulty gene gives us a reason as to why this has all happened.  It also meant that I could put up a reasonable argument to the surgeon as to why I thought I should have a Bilateral Mastectomy, rather than just removing the cancerous breast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, this has implications for Imogen and Felix, but we’ll cross that bridge later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;support-team&quot;&gt;Support Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ross and I moved to Baldock, we took a punt.  It was a decision based on train times and costs into central London where we were both working, and the fact that it had countryside and trees around it.  We didn’t know anyone. It was a gamble and luckily for us, it paid off.  When we had Imogen I met a wonderful group of Ladies who had all had babies at around the same time and are now what we refer to as The Gin Club.  Not much Gin gets consumed, more tea and biscuits really, and wine on a night out.  I’ve known these ladies for nearly 8 years now, and they have proved their mettle. We would not have been able to do this without their support - day in, day out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dad and Julie have also been fantastic.  Coming to stay for weeks at a time to look after the bairns so that I can rest, and Ross can work.
Here’s also a shout out to all my Internet Weirdy friends.  People that I don’t necessarily see very often in real life, but give a lot of positivity through the wonders of the World Wide Web. Everytime you click that ‘Like’ button, it reminds me, I’m not doing this on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-always-up&quot;&gt;Not Always Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post may make it sound like I’m skipping around shouting, “Look at me, I’m so lucky to have breast cancer”.  It’s not like that, I’d prefer that I hadn’t been diagnosed.  We’ve had a really tough 8 months, with still quite a way to go.  I have cried, I have wondered “Why Me?”, I’ve thought “But I don’t want to die!”.  But my point is that whilst the whole situation is a bit crap, and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone, there’s been things that have happened that have made my cancer treatable and the situation manageable.  And for that I am truly thankful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much Love&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Sometimes things happen that make you re-evaluate what is important to you.&lt;p&gt;Being diagnosed with Cancer at 36 years old is one of those things.  We’d just moved into our forever house, Ross was really enjoying work, I was working 4 days a weeks as a Software Development Team Leader and we were comfortable.  Things had started to be less of a struggle.  And then, Bam!, everything gets spun around and we, as are family, are left reeling and wondering which way is up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to work throughout the initial operations and Chemotherapy, mainly working from home.  Unfortunately this left me extremely fatigued and as a result my energy levels for spending with the bairns and Ross were depleted.  They weren’t getting anything from me, nevermind the best of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our break to Center Parcs, I had my big operation, and I haven’t been back to work since.  I found I was still suffering with fatigue, and the Oncologist assured me that this was perfectly understandable after all the treatments I’ve been through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the May half term I was able to have some great days with the bairns and just enjoy being a Mummy.  Generally followed by a long nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work had been going through a lot of changes as a result of a joint venture between two big European companies.  As a result of this there was some restructuring and I was given the opportunity to take Voluntary Redundancy.  Ross and I decided that it was something I should go for.  My priority needs to be my family.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, my application was successful, and yesterday was officially my last day at work.  I have mixed feelings about it, I worked there for four years, and met some really interesting people.  I also learned a lot, and hopefully I’ll be able to transfer that to any new job I get in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are going to be tight for us until I start working again, but you can’t put a price on being here, being with my family.  We’ll manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll pop in and collect my photo’s of the bairns once I’ve finished my radiotherapy and say goodbye to everyone properly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">After saying I wasn&#39;t going to go out last night, I changed my mind.&lt;p&gt;I’m very glad I did.  At about 7:30pm after discussing it with Ross we decided it would do me good to go out.  So after a mad rush to get changed and put my makeup on, I met the Gin Club at the George for cocktails.  It was a good night, with a lot of laughter, and some much needed distraction form the current treatment.  It’s good to be reminded that life goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, upon my return home, I had a bad nights sleep, with a recurring theme of decapitated LEGO men.  Imogen was up with the pain from her ear infection and Ross didn’t have a great night either.  Felix has taken to sleeping with swords, NERF guns and shields so he can fight the monsters in his bad dreams.  (I can’t even begin to imagine how scared he must be.)  Luckily, he seemed to be ok last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we had to go to the pet shop to get some Worming tablets for the cats.  Merlin has become quite the hunter, and after leaving a baby crow on the lawn yesterday morning, Ross was greeted with a rat and a decapitated magpie today. As the sun was shining, we decided to walk and let the bairns go on their bikes.  We also had a quick peek at bikes for Ross and I in Halfords.  Maybe in the next month or two we can think about getting them as it’ll be great to take the kids out on country rides once I’m starting to feel more human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the sun is shining, and we’re keeping on, keeping on.  As is standard for us Lawley’s, (Baldock Branch).&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I&#39;ve finished the first week of radiotherapy.  Only two weeks to go.&lt;p&gt;I’m finding the breath holding technique to be getting easier as the week’s gone on.  The Radiographers, who are lovely, keep telling me to relax, but it’s not the most relaxing of environments, so it’s quite a challenge.  It’s quite tiring having a two hour round trip for a 20 minute appointment everyday, but luckily, I don’t have to drive myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a minor spanner in the works with my surgery wound.  I had been getting it drained every week and a half, but my Oncologist asked me not to have it done once I’d had my radiography planning appointment.  This had been fine, and the wound seemed to have stabilised.  Then on Tuesday night, it seemed to fill with fluid.  I told the Radiographers on Wednesday and in the pre treatment scan, they were able to see that every day since then, it’s filled more.  After discussing it with the Oncologist, it was decided that I should be drained again, as it coud affect the treatment.  Luckily I was able to see the surgeon yesterday, and he drained away 50ml.  Unfortunately it’s still swollen and quite sore.  Meh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for how I’m doing “in myself”, I’m ok.  I’m not 100% great, I’m quite tired, and I’m finding that I’m avoiding social situations where I’d normally be first at the bar.  I think the problem comes with the stress of the anticipation.  Impromptu events cause less of a problem, but I missed my really good friends Rachel’s birthday drinks, because I couldn’t face it. (Sorry Rach x). I’m going to miss Anna’s drinks tonight too. Just thinking about trying to find something to wear, getting to the bar and then chatting is making me quite tearful.  I’ll just stay in, wearing my comfies, and drink a sparkling water.  Sorry Anna x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news this week, Imogen has been suffering with an ear infection.  She’s been in quite a lot of pain.  So after a dash to the GP’s on Monday she’s been taking antibiotics since.  Unfortunately they haven’t worked so Ross had to take her to the out of hours GP today to get her some more and this time they’ll hopefully work!  Apparently it tastes disgusting, so she’s less than impressed.  Poor Lamb.  :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It now 5 weeks until the Race For Life.  The Gin Club are all upping the ante and my Facebook feed is full of posts stating how much training is going on, admittedly, some are more positive than others. It makes me smile, and very humbled and proud to be able to call them friends.  Thanks to them we’ve passed our fundraising target of £500, but there’s still time if anyone has a few quid they can spare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a few strips about breast cancer as his fiancé contracted it a few years

apt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh - I’ve also added one to Julia’s last post as it was relevant ;)&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I&#39;m aware that I haven&#39;t been writing much on the blog recently, but that&#39;s because not much has been happening, and that&#39;s a good thing.&lt;p&gt;We’re on a pretty even keel at the minute.  I’ve been spending time with the bairns and enjoying feeling relatively normal.  I’m still getting tired easily, and have to make allowances for myself.  I’m also feeling a bit vulnerable.  I took the bairns to Tesco the other day, and it seemed everyone was staring at me.  Even Imogen noticed and said “Mummy, that lady is really staring at you”. What can I say to that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a few people in the school yard who seem to be blatantly ignoring me.  People who I’ve spoken to at length in the past.  I don’t know whether they are doing it because they don’t know what to say, whether they think I’ll start crying, or that I’ll just talk about Cancer at length.  Fact is, if someone says hello to me, I generally smile, and say “Hi” back.  If someone asks me how I’m doing, I’ll probably respond with a “Fine”, (this annoys Ross when I say it to the surgeon, or the oncologist, but that’s another story).  Ignoring me feels cruel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, things are about to go a bit mental again when I start radiotherapy on the 2nd June.  I had a 2 hour planning appointment yesterday where I had everything explained to me.  From what to expect during treatment, to what toiletries I’m allowed to use.  I also had to get to grips with some breathing equipment and googles.  Basically, because the radiotherapy is focused on my left chest near my heart, they use technology whereby I use a mouthpiece and software to control my breathing so that my heart is moved away from my chest walls so they can aim the beams to miss it and protect it.  I have to practice holding my breath for 36 seconds.  Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for them to set the radiotherapy up, I had to have 5 tattoo dots and then a CT scan to allow them to plan the best path for the beams to hit the bits they need to.  I’m a bit disappointed with the dot tattoos if I’m honest.  Once all this is over, I’ll get a proper one to cover the scars.  I might as well, I’ve already had the first ink, and I didn’t really have a choice in it.  If I’m honest, I’ve never really thought tattoos were for me.  But, the cancer has taken so much from me, I’m looking at it as a way of reclaiming my body as mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ll be gearing myself up for 3 weeks of treatment.  In the meantime, it’s half term, and I get some quality time with my bairns.  I imagine they’ll be out on their bikes, at the park and generally having fun.  Just what we all need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tattoo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tattoo&quot; title=&quot;I calculate that the electrons in radiation therapy hit you at 99.8% of the speed of light, and the beam used in a 90-second gamma ray therapy session could, if fired with less precision, kill a horse (they did not let me test this).&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“No winter lasts forever, no spring skips it’s turn.”
&lt;br /&gt;Hal Borland (1900-1978)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a harsh winter and Julia nobly dealt with cocktails of drugs. They made her hair fall out and drove her to bone crushing depths of fatigue but I’m so immensely proud of her courage, dignity and tenacity in coping with it all.  The kids also make me so proud, they’ve shown resilience, understanding and acceptance throughout and have lived the last 8 months with cheerful courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring has truly arrived and it just seems the good news keeps rolling in. After being declared cancer free - thanks to heady cocktail of drugs and a quick flick of the surgeons knife, we went back to the chemotherapy doctor.  He was so pleased with the pathology results and really questioned if there was any need for a second round of chemotherapy.  Seems the long term implications outweighed the possible benefits, especially as they couldn’t find any cancer under the microscope for it to treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still a long road and to cover all bases Julia is now scheduled for 12 more rounds of Herceptin, which has much fewer side effects than chemotherapy and is super effective against Julia’s type of cancer.  She’ll also be on other meds for 10 years but all in all it was better than we hoped and a great result!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, there was the Baldock beer festival over the weekend and Uncle Max came over for it especially. I even volunteered to work behind the bar for a couple of hours, having never worked behind a bar before I found it a baptism of fire. It certainly was manic but I think I enjoyed it :) I’m up for doing a stint next year to see if I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of good news and a beer festival certainly gave me a fuzzy head and the optimism of spring has really hit home this year.&lt;/p&gt;
