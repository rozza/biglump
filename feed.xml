  <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the
alarm goes off at 5.10 I have no idea where I am or who I am - but its time to
load the car. Once we’re nearly ready I wake Imogen, who jumps out of bed saying
“Finally, I’ve been waiting all night!” - Felix was less pleased to be woken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We flew up the A1 only hindered by Lorries playing the overtaking game. The one
where they swing out into the fast lane and then try to overtake the Lorry in
front as slowly as possible. We get to the grandparents, help set up a Halloween
party and I have a beer.  Grandma Julie has been looking forward to Halloween
and made it really special for the kids - thank you Grandma!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family come round for the party. I’ve noticed Julia is taking on a role
of being strong when friends / family cry.  This warms me as it is a sign of Julia’s
inner strength and character that I’m so in love with.  There’s lots of
“I’m not dead you know”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncle Callums pumpkins are amazing, people even had their photo taken with them
when trick or treating us.  Imogen &amp;amp; Felix &lt;strong&gt;loved&lt;/strong&gt; trick or treating. After a nervous start Felix
really got into it, I think he would have happily knocked on every door in
Cullercoats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning Grandma Julie, the kids and I walked Uncle Regans and Grandma
Lindas dogs - that sounds way more complicated that it was. Apart from missing
a massive sign saying park closed - we enjoyed the walk in the park, funnily enough
it was nice and quiet. Julia stayed home and slept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we head to see Grandma Ursula. When talking in the car, we tell
Imogen to help with the “I’m not dead” line and she practices. Felix reacts to it, he
was in a mood anyhow but grunts when she says it. Its becoming obvious that he will
need some help to communicate his feelings - he’s very young and it is impacting
him more than we initially thought. We’ll have to work on being extra understanding
with Felix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia sleeps a lot today, the fatigue worries me but its also a way for her to
charge batteries and prepare for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we have an epic roast and beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off into town to see Newcastle play Chelsea! Granddad Mikie and myself get to go
to the match whilst the other (better?) halves and kids go shopping.  We got the
best deal!  Before the match we all head into Krispy Kremes for doughnuts and coffee.
Group wide chronic indecision about what people want to order hits, its too painful
I had to escape and take Felix to the loo.  There is such a thing as too
much choice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The match was awesome, the first half pretty dull and the crowd was nervous.  But
it the second half Newcastle were attacking the Gallowgate End and the crowd lifted
the team and practically willed the ball into the back of the next. I jumped and
cheered like a loon when the first goal went in.  We went expecting defeat and
came out winners - a brilliant way to spend an afternoon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the match we swung by Regan &amp;amp; Lornas new house, not sure I could have
taken on such a massive project but they’ll get a home exactly as they want it.
The house has been gutted and there’s still a mountain of work to do but from now
on it’ll come together and its going to look fantastic once done.  Looking forward
to seeing it done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pop by Julia’s brothers before heading home.  The drive is long and moods
are low when we get home.  Imogen and Felix got bored in the car and fought
over the no mans land of the middle seat.  No one helps get anything in from
the car and I get grumpy. That evening when Felix is extremely rude again to
mummy. I’m really not happy with about it and once
tempers have cooled and we’ve discussed the whys and how we should have dwelt
with it we hug and become friends again. I think the nerves about
tomorrows operation and cancer in general are leaking out and we must come
closer as a family to get through it and remember &lt;strong&gt;we are a team&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross got us up at 5am this morning for the drive up to Newcastle.  Felix, Imogen and I slept for the first hour or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get to Grandma’s and Ross and the bairn are soon being organised with Halloween preparations.  I have a sleep on the sofa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go and visit my Gran in the afternoon and then it’s back to Grandma’s and Grandad’s for a party with the family.  There were hugs, laughs, thoughtful presents and trick or treating.  The bairns loved it.  I got hugs.  That was nice.  It’s odd talking about my boobs with my brothers and my Dad, but this is important.  They need to know what’s going to happen to me and how I’m feeling about it all.  The fact of the matter is, I have to do what it takes to get my life back.  There is no pussy footing about this.  It’s going to be a hard road, I realise that, but it won’t be forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen reads Grandma and Grandad the Mummy’s Lump book.  She’s already read it to her cousin Holly, and the only word she struggled with was Chemotherapy.  Why should a seven or eight year old know that word?  It’s hardly everyday vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncle Callum’s highly regarded pumpkin is being used as a nightlight tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept a lot today.  It’s nice to be able to, and know the bairns and Ross are looked after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to see my Mam this afternoon.  It’s been a while since we saw her but Imogen and Felix were great.  Something’s also don’t change.  She was telling me how I feel about having Breast Cancer.  I’m shocked.  Clearly I can’t choose my own emotions and feelings at 36years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought some headwear for when I lose my hair with the chemo.  I got some online, and others from an actual real life shop.  It’s still all a bit surreal.  Also discussing health insurance whilst waiting to have the kids feet measured was a bit odd.  Things are just going to get more odd, so I may as well get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today has been quite hectic.  Ross accompanied my Dad to see Newcastle play Chelsea at St James Park, and Imogen, Felix, grandma Julie and I did some shopping.  A successful afternoon all round with the Toon winning 2 nil, and purchasing Imogen’s new school boots, and Christmas outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home we saw Regan and Lorna’s new house.  They astound me.  They’ve got two 7 month old babies, and are gutting a house.  It’ll be fantastic, I’ve no doubt, but Wowsers, there’s work to do.  I’m looking forward to seeing it all done up.  Something else to aim for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made an impromptu visit to see Karen and Alison, two of my oldest friends.  I’m glad I did.  There were hugs and tears, but also promises of support and laughter.  There’s a reason I have the friends I do, both the old ones and the (relatively) newer ones.  Mainly because they are fantastic, and I can be me. I don’t have to pretend to be someone I’m not, and they accept me as I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re off home tomorrow. It’s been a good trip. But I’m not sure when I’ll be up next.  That worries me a bit, as we normally come up every 3 or 4 months, but as we just don’t quite know what’s going to happen, we can’t make plans.  It’s been a great few days.  My family are fantastic and it’s good to know I’ve got their support.  My Dad and Julie, are amazing.  They have so much on their own plate with one thing and another, and still make it seem like nothing is too much trouble.  Much love to them.  Don’t go changing. X&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, I’ve even told I’m very brave, pragmatic, stoic and tenacious in my attitude and reaction to my diagnosis.  But what can I do?  I have no other choice.  I have to fight.  I have to fight for my future, because in fighting for my future I’m fighting for the future of my kids and my family, and that’s what’s important.  They need me, and I need them so I’ve got something to fight for.   I have no choice.  There is no other option.  &lt;strong&gt;I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO FIGHT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We called in to see my brothers and their families before we headed home.  Ross did a sterling job of driving and 4 hours later we were walking in the front door to be greeted by the cats.  They were very happy to see us, and us them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all be a bit shouty at each other this afternoon.  I think it’s the stress of tomorrow leaching out.  We all need to remember to be kind to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was trying to tie up some loose ends today with work as I was expecting a phone call with final confirmation from the consultant that Monday’s operation is definitely happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to an extent, but it did mean I left work late, hit traffic, and I’m now very tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the consultant rang he told me the best news.  The CT scan came back clear.  The Cancer is localised and there’s no more in my body between my neck and the top of my legs.  The operation on Monday will establish whether there’s any Cancer in the lymph nodes and I am keeping everything crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultant has been thinking about the best treatment plan for me and for the first time mentioned radiotherapy.  The problem is, if I have to have that, I’ll not be able to have the mastectomy and reconstruction at the same time.  It could be up to a year between the two.  I think he was trying to gauge my reaction to this proposed course of action.  To be honest, if that does happen, it’s not going to be the worst thing in the world that I’d have to face.  I have priorities.  These are watching Imogen and Felix grow up, and getting to an age ripe old age with Ross so we can sit and hold hands and look out to sea when we’ve both got grey hair (well, me with grey hair, Ross will still be bald).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been getting lots of lovely messages from people who I haven’t spoken to for ages.  These are very much appreciated.  I do try and respond to eveyone because I appreciate that people have taken the time to comment/message etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got home, dinner was on the table and the laundry had been done.  My husband is amazing, and I love him very much.  I’m very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off to visit my family up North tomorrow.  I’m going to get lots of hugs and every single one of them will be well received and I’m looking forward to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The CT Scan yesterday and the operation being moved to Monday has taken its toll.  This is now
real and Julia is scared.  What happens if the CT Scan shows something up?  Her
shoulder has been sore and it’s hard not to correlate the two things. I tell her
we have to take things one day at a time, one step at a time and I’m with her
all the way.  We don’t sleep well, I dose and when I awake, I rub her back
- it will be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen decides 6:40am is a good time to wake up and comes into the bedroom, telling
me she forgot to set her alarm.  She’s worried she’s slept in! I’m not too kind as
I tell her to get BACK to her room.  It’s ok though, she gets her own back by deciding
now’s a good time to do recorder practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replacement tv cabinet arrives early, we get it set up and the kids scramble
about helping me hoover up the polystyrene bits so we can send a pic to mummy. It
looks great.  Then it’s time for Felix to get his hair cut, the last time we went
to the new barbers I practically had to push him in there when he saw the barber
was a lady.  He’s over it and practically jumps into the seat - he knows there’s
a lollypop coming post hair cut.  I get my hair cut as well, a grade zero which
also saw a cut throat razor. It’s hard not to gulp when one of those comes out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia has had her CT Scan results all clear! F*ck yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old owners had a crate of wine delivered by accident - decisions, decisions…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon involves laundry, Jesus ironing sucks.  Roll on the tumble dryer,
as no t-shirt will need ironing again.  Our neighbour kindly takes the kids out
for a walk and I steam some creases. Rock and Roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now cooking tea, drinking wine and looking forward to seeing the inlaws in Toon
tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Trying to avoid the public displays of affection from the two youngsters sat opposite me in a very small waiting room, and a drip which  made me feel hot, which was just as well as the room’s air con seemed to be set to cold gale.  Not pleasant when you’re wearing a hospital gown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a joke with the radiographers which lightened the mood somewhat.  I seem to have a habit of trying to lighten things up.  Is it my job to do that?  Probably not, but if I don’t then who will?  Do people think I’m going to cry or talk about cancer all the time?  I don’t know, but I haven’t changed my personality.   I can still be a cow, granted, but that’s normal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a long conversation with the health insurance company, which resulted in a conversation with my Consultant, and the first operation potentially being brought forward to Monday.  This Monday.  After the weekend Monday.  6 days time Monday.  (When I was supposed to be getting the new washing machine delivered.  That’s now been changed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scares me.  It means that I really am on this journey.  It’s not a dream, and it is happening to me.  Sometimes it feels like this is all happening to someone else.     Having an operation means it is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m having a glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stuff is moving, progress is happening and this makes me feel positive.  Sleeping
well also makes me feel positive.  We drop the kids off at friends (thanks Lesley!) and
dash down the A1 to the QE2.  The hospital has the worst frontage of any I’ve
ever seen, to be fair I’m not that experienced. Today the sun is out and it looks
less depressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia is made to suffer some form of water torture; drink a litre of
special stuff to help the scan out and isn’t allowed to go to the loo.
She cracks on and drinks away. I watch iplayer on the ipad whilst waiting -
downloads for the win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get nervous when Julia grabs me and we have to wait in another room - but she
was just saving me from the smallest waiting room and wanting company.  Once she’s
given the all clear to the dye injection we head off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia wasn’t as pleased as I was about the insurance.  She worried we’ll have
to schlep miles to the private hospital for chemo, so we decide to find out what’s
what.  It’s good news we can dip in and out the NHS, this feels wierd but I suppose
it saves them money so its mutally beneficial.  Her first operation can now be done
next week - its scarily close but we’ll know what we are facing sooner and start
taking steps to getting Julia healthy quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling positive and having wine too!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s half term, so the kids are up bright and early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got the kids today and as Julia heads off to work, I
get the kids up for breakfast and a then a healthy dose of Disney Infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We head out for a walk to see what damage the storms have done, not too much in
Baldock it seems. We wear wellies and jump in all the puddles :)  Then it rains
and we run back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felix who hasn’t talked much about what’s going on asks “How old will you be
when you die?”. Not sure if its just a standard five year olds question or if
he’s worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the arvo we do some homework. Imogen does recorder practice and I read with
Felix.  Imogen had started getting annoyed and shouting at the recorder, so
I have a go on the recorder and turn the tables by getting Imogen to teach me.
In no time she she aces the tune!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We head into the garden I do some pruning, this involves getting the electric saw out and
removing a straggly bush altogether.  This gardening lark is easy. I then WD40
the squeaky doors upstairs and fix Imogens curtain rail.  This diy lark is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felix offers me his piggy bank to pay for the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a call from the health insurance folk and our claim has been authorised - great
news, Julia can have the best care now and be seen quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really pleased and quite tired after just a day of looking after the bairns!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was good to catch up and as it was just us, we went at my pace - most would hardly
call it a run!!  We plodded round Ivel springs and up to Radwell meadows, good
stuff and I’m determined to get fit - to both keep sane by working out
frustrations and to build the strength and stamina I will need in the coming
months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breaky, it’s over to the swimming pool for the kids lessons. I was pleased
there were less people in the swimming lane and I could charge up and down the
pool.  Felix swam his first ever length of backstroke, I was egging him on from
the otherside of the lane rope (I don’t think he noticed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, I walk into a room and Julia says “I could die” and bursts into
tears, I hug her tight and cry. It’s not been said so far and it needed airing
as hard and hopefully unlikely it is. We talk and try and try to regain a proper
perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a great tea (go Lidl ingredients!) I call my dad. It is his birthday and I
had forgotten. I apologise profusely and I’m angry at myself, I could have
sworn it was not until the 29th.  I’m rubbish.  The kids sing happy birthday
and I hope that made up for it in some part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to sleep and feel very low, probably despair or some other
dark mood - I’m not use to those feelings and they seem so alien to me and my
personality. I’m ill equiped to cope but a quick sob and hugs from Julia sort me
right out.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve ordered a new washing machine and tumble dryer.  My existing washer is 9 years old and sounds like its going to take off when it spins.  That’s not going to be very conducive to a relaxing recovery.  The tumble dryer will just make life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also spoken to my wonderful hairdresser.  I’ve decided that there’s no point having my hair coloured if its going to fall out and cancelled my appointments scheduled between now and Christmas. Instead I’ve made one for a couple of weeks time to have it cut short.  My reasoning is that when it falls out it doesn’t come as such big change.  It’ll also take less time to maintain and that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to a local fireworks display on Saturday night with our friends.  There was beer and company.  Good for us all.  The fireworks were fantastic and we all had a great time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clocks went back an hour this morning and thanks to a later than normal night, the bairns got up at a reasonable time.  I stayed in bed as long as I could.  I seem to be using sleep as a coping mechanism.  If I’m asleep I can’t think about things, and there’s some things I don’t want to think about.   Unfortunately, I’m sleepwalking.  I’ve got form.  I do it in times of stress.  Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched my little fish at their swimming lessons.  Felix has come on so well in the last few weeks.  He can now swim a whole 25m length on his own.  And Imogen is amazing.  I just wish she’d listen to the teacher so she can improve her technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this afternoon, I slept on the sofa whilst family life continued around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross is being fantastic.  He’s picking up the slack already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to work tomorrow.  During the Storm of St Jude, patron saint of lost causes.  The two are not connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I go downstairs and kitten therapy works wonders! Merlin is a needy little thing in the morning, he keeps stopping me writing this on the ipad - some things are simply more important, it seems! I re read Julia’s post from yesterday it’s great, I’m so proud of my wonderful wife and I know that this blog will give us strength in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s little ruggers day for Felix, I take Imogen along so Julia can rest up - she’s got batteries to charge. I feel bad but I ignore the other parents that I usually speak to, I can’t face the usual chit chat today. I left the ipad at home so Imogen and I sit and read the paper in the school canteen whilst Felix plays rugby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I’m ambushed by a sad story about a photographer documenting his wife’s journey with breast cancer. Tears fill my eyes, it’s the last thing I was expecting, someone has documented my worse fear. I have to remind myself all cancers are different, Julia is strong and we are getting the best care possible. Imogen doesn’t see it and I quickly turn the page and the conversation brightens. It seems cancer is everywhere at the moment, tv campaigns, movember, in the papers. I’m hypersensitive now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felix enjoyed little ruggers and we head home via the supermarket. I start to reply to the kind messages from work mates, I tell Imogen to get ready for dance class and off she goes. Suddenly I notice the time, I shout Imogen, she comes downstairs in her normal clothes! This makes me laugh, she has been faffing again! A quick change on the stairs and we just make it to the class on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, Imogen and I clean out the smelly gerbils and do some planting in the garden. I cook enchiladas for dinner, Julia and I love them, Imogen is ambivalent, Felix decides with his eyes we are trying poison him. Lots of threats about not going to the fireworks gets him to eat it. Julia talked about having to save money and eat healthy to the kids this morning. They both agreed but being presented enchiladas on the same day is simply too much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s firework night at the school, there’s someone killing the guitar and doing tenacious d covers when we arrive, I grab the beer and we chat to friends. The kids go on some tumble dryer style ride - I’m terrified for them. Felix looked panicky at the start and they are being rolled into big kids, I expect tears but they both come off beaming “Awesome!” Imogen lost her hat in the excitement and has to fight through the queue to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More beers and friends arrive. It’s so great to see them, Julia and I notice the differences in how friends (the dads) handle the situation, that’s ok it’s big bad news. We quickly break the ice and the conversation soon starts flowing. It all feels wonderfully normal, the kids all sit to watch the fireworks together “oooing”, “arrhhhing” and sometimes screaming together. The display was great and we head home tired and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was a good day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R x&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s been a hint of normality today.  I enjoyed it.  But I have a feeling there’s going to be far fewer days like it.  There was also some not so normal bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had lots of hugs from friends on the school run.  There was a few tears, but I reminded them that “I’m not dead!”  I also said I would be requesting hugs often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Pilates and told my teacher that today would be my last class for a while.  I’ve been really enjoying them so may go back for the odd session as and when I feel up to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was the dentist.  See?  Normal things!  This is what normal people do!  As I was walking round town, I felt like running up to random strangers going about their normal business and saying “Don’t you know?  Can’t you see?  I’ve got Breast Cancer.”  Mentalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was lunch at the Orange Tree.  Again.  Normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A call from the hospital was next to arrange a CT scan.  Not your everyday occurrence.  That’s now booked for next Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was a 15 minute call with my GP.  Who called me.  That’s not really normal is it?  It’s generally quite hard to get in touch with a GP.  And she’s told me she’s going to get one of the asthma nurses to give me a call as she wants me to get me to have a flu jab before my first operation, and ensure my asthma is ok and the rest of me is on top form before they start taking me apart to put me back together.  I tried to make an appointment at the beginning of October.  But the soonest they could give me was 7th November.  Magically, that’s going to be brought forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read something, or was told something somewhere but I can’t remember where or who.  Its regarding treating cancer and it didn’t seem relevant at the time.  It was “it takes a year of your life to get your life back”.  I’m 36 years old.  I’ve got a small family who need me, so I keep telling them, so if it takes a year to do this, I’ll do it.  I’ll take it head on and fight all the way.  The alternative is just too horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few statistics for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with cancer in their life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 in 10 of these women will be under 50.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2010, 136 women were told they had breast cancer on any given day.
(135 women are now going through the same thing as me 48 hours after being told the devastating news.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer, do one.  You’re not claiming me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hugged Julia tight and my sobs woke her. Not the nicest way to start the day
for her and I feel guilty for doing it. It’s as if my emotions have betrayed me
somehow. We talk and I feel better - it seems crying really works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems we forgot to set Felix’s alarm last night, Julia set me a challenge to
set Felix’s alarm on without waking him. (I still haven’t got round to WD40’ing
the door hinges upstairs, they’re straight out of a noir horror film - almost
comically so). I creep in set it and retreat. Julia tells me the “on” setting
is up. Bugger, I’d just turned it off. I creep in again, set the alarm and Felix
rolls over, snores loudly (atta boy) and then wakes… oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids wake, we get hugs from the kids and get them to school. I’m
apprehensive, as ours friends know but we’ve yet to see them. It’s as if
seeing them makes it more real. Stupid really, seeing them give Julia hugs
and talking about it is &lt;strong&gt;enormously&lt;/strong&gt; reassuring. There were tears and disbelief
but I see it brightens Julia - we are lucky to have such great friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia has messages to do this morning, so I’m back home having a coffee and on
the laptop. I buy our old domain back and hunt for a blog engine, Jekyll wins as
it’s easiest and has themes.  We get the blog up and I grab Julia’s diary
entries and throw it on the web (o hai!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell work and friends on twitter, the support messages are great.  Cancer
isn’t a rarity, many stories of how it touched peoples lives have come out and
in a strange way it’s good to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll have a beer tonight and look forward to the firework display tomorrow.
Next week it’s half term and time to chill with the kids and see family.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today has passed in a bit of a blur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 4am, and got up an hour later to send some work emails and put something live.  Funny what you think is important…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d inadvertently woken Ross up so we chatted eventually falling asleep not long before the children woke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got them into bed with us, and read them a book called Mummy’s Lump.  It was a very high level book which discussed a bad lump, cutting it out, and strong medicine which would make my hair fall out.  They asked some questions, felt Big Lump, and what the operation would mean.  We told them my boob would be cut off.  Imogen was a bit upset, but Felix didn’t really understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this made us a bit late for school. Not by much but Felix wasn’t impressed.  We went to see Mrs Summerhayes as she would be able to ensure that things were put in place to ensure Imogen and Felix were given additional support as and when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day has involved a trip to the doctors to get things signed, a trip to the supermarket, a walk round Radwell Meadows, an awkward conversation with my mother, ( who’s immediate reaction was to light a cigarette),  a light lunch, and a nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also told the Gin Club.  As expected the offers of help were overwhelming and also humbling.  They are a great group of friends, and were lucky to have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some beautiful flowers arrive from Dad and Julie with a card saying they were thinking if us. A conversation with my Dad followed, which was less emotionally fraught than yesterday’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross is flying solo at parents evening.  I can’t face it to be honest.  First parents evening I’ve missed.  But it needs to be focused on the kids.  I’m too much of a zombie and too leaky to make myself anything other than a nuisance right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross has been great and continues to be my rock, and to help me use our sense of humour to get us through.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Julia is downstairs putting some code live, she can’t sleep and said she’d do it
yesterday when the world was normal.  If you can’t sleep its good to focus on
something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We told the kids before school, both Julia and I choked back tears when reading
“Mummy’s Lump” - a book about breast cancer given to us yesterday.  How did it
come to this?  I found it achingly difficult, so we went over it again.  We told
Imogen &amp;amp; Felix to make sure they don’t bottle it up. Imogen seems to understand but
Felix is a different matter, he wanted to know more about the lump and wanted to
feel it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the kids in late to school and spoke to the head mistress.  She was great
and understanding of the situation.  The kids will get a card to hold up if they
ever need time out.  No questions will be asked they can go and sit with the head
mistress and chill.  This is an enormous comfort and its good to know the kids are
in safe hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call my mum up again are a text from dad, saying he’s thinking of us and
struggling to get his head round the news.  Its good talking to mum, she’s still
in shock but is being pragmatic and asking questions about the treatment. This time
I cry as I express my fears.  The biggest being I’m worried I won’t live up to
expectations and be strong enough for Julia.  Today has been a really leaky day
for my eyes!  And emotions are still so strong and raw - it’s a lot to take in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I email the gin club dads telling them about the news and
that I will need help, support, beers and sometimes to escape the insanity of the
family in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia has a nap and I head off to parents evening. Its good to focus on the kids
and they are both doing well.  Imogen is having her normal first half term of the
year issues - some alpha positioning thing with the teacher and class mates.  The
teacher loves her passion and there are a few things to work on but on the whole
shes settling in this year great.  I think the teacher was shocked when Imogen did
a “My Mums got Breast Cancer” talk for show and tell!  &lt;em&gt;Well we did say don’t
bottle it in!&lt;/em&gt;  Felix’s review was &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;, he’s such a
lovely boy and the teachers are really impressed with him and his progress.
Julia and I are lucky to have such fantastic kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, I start to feel more lucid and actually myself.  Julia and I
chill watching rot on the TV and it feels closer to normal.  All our close
friends and family know and I plan on setting up a blog tomorrow to help get these
feelings out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Julia immediately noticed we were seeing Mr rather than Dr and commented to the nurse, who gave a non committal reply. One quick examination then into a room with with two nurses and the consultant (this can’t be good news). It’s cancer and my fears of the last two weeks and last few months have been realised.  We are told quickly and honestly that it will involve operations, chemo and a mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m holding Julia’s hand and notice it’s shaking, I squeeze tight. Desperately listening, trying to ensure I take it all in, but the news is too big to fit my head and to comprehend fully. After, we are taken to a quiet room and given a moment. We hug and cry, it’s shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nurse comes in, Julia says its a bit shit, the nurse replies almost whispering its crap. We get the information again and can, this time digest it more.  We are given a library of books on cancer, I joke to Julia “you don’t have time to be ill as she has so much reading todo”. It’s not funny, but we’ll need our sense of humour in the coming months, so best start dusting it off now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We leave, I cry in the car, I’m so angry, upset and worried. I’m a man and it’s hard having a months / years worth of feelings in 5 minutes. Crying, as always makes me feel better, but I feel bad doing it in front of Julia as if I’m off loading onto her - she has one job now and that’s to get better and needs me to be strong.  I’m fully realising I need to create and use a support network to ensure I can get these feelings out and stay strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving home Julia starts phoning and telling her family.  I’m amazed by her strength on those calls - I’m still digesting the news and the content of the calls feels surreal. We get the kids, I drop them all off at home and head to the supermarket for cancer drugs and beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call Rich, he’s stunned and I seem to be broken with emotion. I can’t get my words out and repeatedly choke back tears. Richie is ace, says the right things.  He says Julia is a tough Geordie and we will get through this.  I think the nicest thing he says is that Julia and I “are love” as if we help define the word, I like the description. He offers to help out anyway he can and if we ever need him he’s only a couple of hours away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back home beers in hand. Felix reads a story to me, his reading is coming on and he’s starting to take pride in reading (when he’s not randomly guessing every other word). I phone my mum. It’s a hard call, she wasn’t expecting the news and is stunned. I somehow manage not to boo during this call, she asks lots of questions but I can tell she is stunned, quiet and I leave her crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen senses things aren’t right, she’s been downstairs three times after bedtime.  The third time she’s been told to get back to bed. Weirdly, she picks now to start crying and talk about her own world ended and dying. Not sure where that came from but it seems school and Boudicca are to blame ?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drink beers, watch telly and discuss what’s happening and the future. It’s a lot to handle but the journey has started and we know where we need to get to.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to be working today. And I did, to an extent. But I was very distracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross and I got to the hospital 15 minutes early and got in to see the doctor at just after 5.  I saw the main man.  That made me worry.  And justifiably so as it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have breast cancer.  I have it in more than one place.  The saving grace is that it’s only in one of my boobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not the news I wanted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the next couple of weeks I need a CT scan to see if its spread anywhere else. I’ll see the consultant in two weeks to discuss the results and that dictates the big decisions.  I also need a small operation to see if there’s any cancer in the lymph nodes.  That’s on the 14th November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that its chemotherapy and a mastectomy.  I lose a boob and my hair.  I also have a course of herceptin, similar to chemo but more expensive and less side effects.  I started on tamoxifen today also which is supposed to stop the cancer in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve told Dad, Julie, Callum, Regan and Max.  I’ve made them promise hugs.  A couple of close friends also know as they’ve been helping me through the wait for results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next task is to tell the bairns.  This isn’t going to be pleasant.  But Ross and I have a plan and we are going to do it together.  Once the kids know, it’ll become public knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so angry right now.  And being quite petulant with the “why me!” Attitude.  And tearful.  Meh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are where we are.  There’s a journey to go on.  There’s a few way points, but we don’t know the route yet.  It’s going to be tough, but the troops have been mobilised and its going to be ok.  I’ve got a Race For Life to do in July, and I will do it.  Even if I have to walk…and I’ve never walked one!

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been keeping busy at work which has meant I haven’t really had time to dwell to much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a bit of a problem when it comes to setting up new Life Insurance though.  We meant to get it sorted once we moved into the new house to cover the new mortgage, but because we’ve already some cover, and Ross has Death in Service cover, it wasn’t a top priority.  I’m now regretting that decision.  If anything happens to me, the majority of the mortgage will be paid off, but it will still mean that Ross has to work to cover the remaining mortgage.  That on top of child care costs isn’t going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we know one way or the other we’ll be getting it sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I keep getting cross about is why the scan in June didn’t pick up that the Big Lump wasn’t normal.  I need to stop dwelling on it, but I kept going back to the doctor and I feel like I’ve been fobbed off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we’re just waiting to see what next Wednesday brings.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We firstly took Merlin to the vets to get his first lot of jabs.  The vet was happy  he was a sociable cat, and gave plenty of advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was off to Little Ruggers and ballet.  A quick razz around Sainsburys and it was back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was followed by the ironing, then sorting the under stairs cupboard and then a sit on the sofa watching Bondi Vet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to get a bit low during that, so after seeing some pictures, made our sloe gin and blackberry vodka.  Imogen and Felix helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner came soon after and them we watched Strictly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merlins been a bit lethargic today, but that’s down to the jabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross has managed to alter his schedule and he’s coming home tonight instead of Monday.  This makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been 48 hours since I was at the QEII in Welwyn having a mammogram, scan and biopsy that will tell me what the increasing number of lumps in my left breast are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big lump has been around since the beginning if May. I did what I needed to and went to the GP straight away.  She didn’t seem worried and told me it was probably hormonal changes.  I wasn’t convinced, so told her I wanted to come back for her to have another look.  Again, she told me not to worry, but would refer me if I was worried.  Worried?  Of course I was worried!  I’ve breast fed both my kids for over a year each, and watched my boobs go through all sorted of weird changes.  This wasn’t normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got an appointment at the local breast unit for a scan at the beginning if June.  I was seen by the doctor, and then scanned.  I was quite sure that the area of my breast where the lump was, wasn’t scanned, but, I’m not the expert, so didn’t really push the point when I was told it was normal breast tissue.  The doctor said he would send me another appointment in 3 months so that we could discuss options.  Possibly an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months went by, the big lump got bigger and two more lumps developed.  The doctor scanned Big lump again and found fluid which either previously wasn’t there, or missed.  She decided I should have more scans as well as a biopsy, as if Big Lump was a cyst, it would be possible to drain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that brings us to Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never had a mammogram before, and most women don’t until the screening programme kicks in at 50, it’s an uncomfortable experience with your boob manhandled into position by a radiographer and then squashed between two plates.  Not very pleasant, but no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, then on to the ultrasound.  The radiologist had looked at my mammograms and decided there was an area he wanted to look at in more detail as well as Big Lump.  So he scanned very thoroughly, including areas that I hadn’t been previously worried about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t expected to sign a consent form, or to have local anaesthetic.  After seeing the size of the biopsy needle, and the fact they had to use a scalpel to break the skin to get it in, I realise why they were necessary.  They took 3-4 specimens from two different areas of my boob.  Given that Big Lump is still with us, I can only assume it wasn’t possible to drain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they had finished and they had cleaned me up, I was told that the radiologist had found some calcium which can be an indicator of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I first found this lump, the medical professionals have been telling me that Big Lump isn’t cancer and I shouldn’t be worried.  But I’ve now got multiple lumps, discharge and to top it off, Calcification.  Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’ve been googling, and scaring myself.  But I’ve got to wait until the 23rd for the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a long two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross is away, but has cut his trip short so he’ll be back late tomorrow night.  He’s also cancelled his trip which was scheduled for when I get the results.  He is my rock.  Keeps me from going mental and is always pragmatic.  I realise this isn’t easy for him, but I just need him to be strong for us both for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen has seen the plasters covering the biopsy wounds and asked about them.  I didn’t know what to say, so fobbed her off.  She asked again yesterday, so I told her that I’d had some tests as I had something in my booby that shouldn’t be there and the doctors needed to find out what it was.  She seemed happy with the explanation.   I haven’t mentioned the C word.  She knows what it is, as Grandad has had cancer.  We ran the Race For Life in July and I thought it important to explain why it was important to raise money for cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felix knows something is up but doesn’t really understand.  He’s been around Imogen when we’ve discussed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are.  In a strange limbo of trying to prepare for an unknown outcome.  I don’t know what it might be, but I have to prepare myself that I may be told I have breast cancer.  I’m hoping its not.  I really am.  Because that would suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then if its not, what on earth is causing these lumps? And the discharge and the calcium?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if its not, then it’s two weeks of worrying for no reason.  And why I don’t want to tell the world,  “I’m waiting for results that will tell me if I have cancer or not.”  “Nope, I don’t…as you were”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, hoping for the best, preparing for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might drink some wine tonight.  And play with Merlin, our new kitten, who we got on the way home from the hospital on Wednesday.  He’s lovely.  The other two cats aren’t too impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;
