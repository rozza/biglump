  <content type="html">We're back, and the washing machine is earning it's keep!&lt;p&gt;My overwhelming memory from the holiday is the feeling of pride I have for my little family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen - determined.  She scrambled up the indoor climbing wall easily, and was quickly tackling harder routes.  The Cyclone ride in the pool posed no issue.  Ross and I were screaming but Imogen just grinned and laughed.  Her swimming in the pool was effortless, and she went down all the slides too many times to count.  When bowling she refused any offers of help, and she managed to beat me every time.  With the adventure golf too, she refused help, and tried her best.  The pottery painting was her idea, and she produced a colourful dragon money box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felix - strong.  He has only really got to grips with riding his bike in the past few months, but he had plenty opportunities to practice.  And he was amazing.  He cycled everywhere, and when he couldn’t ring his bell to signal he was ok, he’d shout “It’s on the other side.”  It took Ross and I a while to work out why he was shouting this, but it turns out it was because his bell had turned itself round so it was on the other side of the handlebars.  His swimming was great in the pool.  It would have been a very different holiday had he not been able to swim.  But swim he did.  Most of the time he was out of his depth, and he was able to go down all the slides on his own apart from the Cyclone because he was just too short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross - hero.  I’m not quite back up to full energy, so the full itinerary of activities meant there wasn’t much leftover for the normal day to day stuff.  But Ross took up all the slack. He did the cooking and organising and took the kids off by himself so I could rest when necessary.  He is amazing, and I’m lucky to have him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, they all rock, and I love them all very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">We've been at Center Parcs for four days now, and we've had a superb time.&lt;p&gt;We’ve cycled everywhere and been swimming every day.  The kids have been on the indoor climbing wall, and as a family we’ve been bowling twice, eaten out a few times, spent a fortune at the amusements, played ping pong and pool, painted pottery, played crazy golf and went on an aerial tree adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s our first holiday here, and I can safely say, we’ll be back.  It’s been so wonderful, and we’ve laughed and smiled pretty much permanently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve managed to keep going most of the time, but I think I’ll need to catch up on some sleep when I get back.  I wouldn’t change it for the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">It's been a while&lt;p&gt;I’ve been busy steering good ship Lawley and whilst I’ve been meaning to write a post I haven’t found the time.  Happily, today I woke at 3:33am after not sleeping well at all, so rather than fight it I thought I’d get up and do something until tireness comes back and I can sleep some more.  The good things are a) that’s not normal, I usually sleep well and b) we’re all going on holiday to Center Parcs in a few hours. The Lawley family are ridiculously excited about this! Before that though, I think it’s high time to digest whats been happening over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia has been off the chemotherapy for a while now and she is bouncing back.  She’s been getting frustrated, as with less fatigue comes the will to do more and then she tires herself out and feels bad about it. What she doesn’t realise is how much more she is doing now compared to a month ago. It’s encouraging but this is a long haul journey and the fact there is another round of chemo on the horizon isn’t too far from our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big news of the week has been the genetic test. It came back with a hit and I wasn’t surprised, it helps explains what before was unexplainable - why Julia? The operation will now be bigger, but there are upsides, we won’t be living in fear that the cancer will appear in the other breast and when reconstruction happens Julia will have a matching pair of new knockers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia took the news hard and saw it as another bad thing to happen to her. Which is understandable, especially as it might have repercussions for the children but the future is a way away and we must live in the present and deal with the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to highlight some of the positives to come out of this all (you have to choose your moments for doing this as part of being supportive is just listening but part of being a man is trying to fix all the things™).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big positive is there is treatment, drugs, therapies and years of experience in this field. It is accounting for something and that collective medical expertise will kill Julia’s cancer.  In just a couple of weeks time Julia should be cancer free the rest of the treatment will be the final clean up operation to ensure that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second chances. Not everyone gets one but in a way Julia has. It’s awful whats happened and I can’t deny that but as awful and traumatic as it has been the treatment will finish and a new normal will occur. That’s the second chance.  I’ve been encouraging Julia to focus on what she wants to get out of life and then to go for it.  The future isn’t written and no one knows how long their own might be so&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose your future, choose life, fuck cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I didn't make it to Anna's on Friday night.  I had a bath and was asleep by 9pm.&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I went to watch the kids have their swimming lesson.  Imogen’s teacher came to  wish us a lovely holiday and gave us a few handy hints on what to do whilst we are at Center Parcs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she’d gone the woman who was sat beside me said, “I couldn’t help overhearing, is it the Easter holidays you are going?” When I said, no it was Monday she asked if my daughter was at school.  I responded by saying both my children were at school, and she asked, rather incredulously, “and the school are ok with that?”.  Now, the swimming pool is hot, and I was sat with my baldy head out.  She clearly hadn’t joined the dots.  I turned to look at her and said, “I’m having treatment for breast cancer.  We’ve had precious little quality time as a family since my diagnosis, and thankfully the school has agreed that these are exceptional circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I was a bit stunned by this exchange.  This woman was judging me for taking my kids out of school.  Believe me, it wasn’t a decision that we took lightly, but the children have been under a lot of stress recently.  It manifests itself in a few different ways.  Tantrums, bed wetting, nightmares, etc.  Imogen and Felix deserve a few days away with their parents to make some magical memories before having more treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crashed on the sofa for the rest of the day.  I hope I have more energy for the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was spent watching rugby training, and then getting organised for holiday.  I can’t wait.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I'm back at the leisure centre where I've written a few of these blog posts.&lt;p&gt;It’s been an odd week.  After getting the genetic test results and then speaking to the oncologist we’ve had a lot to think about.  The CHEK2 gene mutation has been known about in the genetic circles for over ten years but it’s not routinely tested for and as a result there’s no clear guidelines as to how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to my surgeon and he needs to discuss with the multidisciplinary team to decide the best way forward.  It’s not unreasonable in these circumstances to have a risk reducing mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve been trying to gauge how I feel about the double.  To be honest, if it’s going to mean I’ve a better chance keeping this horrible disease at bay, then I’ll have it.  It’s a no brainer really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s been as normal a day as I’ve had in a while.  I took the bairns to school.  I went to a gin club coffee morning at Lesley’s, then Ross and I did a supermarket shop.  I had a nap, and the did the school run, and made tea.  We’ve come to the leisure centre to watch Imogen do gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m supposed to be going to my Gin Club friend, Anna’s house tonight for drinks, but I’m not sure I’ll make it.  I’m tired.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">They say bad things come in three's.  Well, I've just heard what the third one is.&lt;p&gt;When I first found Big Lump, it wasn’t supposed to be cancer.  I’m too young to get cancer.  Unfortunately, it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we had the Sentinal Node Biopsy, to establish whether it had spread.  Everything indicated to it being contained.  It hadn’t, it had spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, the genetic test.  Was I just a one off freak, or a genetic freak who could pass this horrible disease to my children, and also have implications for my close family.  Sadly, the latter is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a mutation in the CHEK2. It’s not even the normal breast cancer gene that everyone is talking about at the minute with the Carol Jackson story in Eastenders, BRCA 1/2.  (I’m not watching it though, I can’t deal with someone else’s fictional drama at the minute).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gene mutation is classed as medium risk.  The BRCA gene is classed as high risk, so I can be thankful for some things.  It’s been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer, as well as colon cancer and prostate cancer in men.   The reason I was checked for this gene, is that it was done privately on Ross’s works health insurance.  The nhs would only have checked for the BRCA one, and even then they may not have agreed to carry out the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had the test, it’s thrown up an issue, now to deal with it.  In the short term, this may be the difference between a single or double mastectomy.  My Oncologist says that given the results, it’s not a case if they remove the other side, but when.  I need to see my surgeon this week before we go on holiday and see if he’ll agree to do it all together.  We then need to see if the insurance company will agree to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, its going to mean things get shaken up a bit.  It’s going to be time to grab life by the balls and live it.  No more stagnating.  No more treading water.  And the first thing I’m going to do once I’m able to, is start singing again.  Join a choir and gain back some confidence I lost a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer, I’m not going to fight you, I’m not a warrior, I’m just little me.  But I’m going to have every treatment they offer me so I can get rid of you, so I can have my life back.  A life with my husband and bairns that you think I don’t deserve.  Back off.   I’m prepared to sacrifice all sorts here, starting with, but not limited to my hair and both boobs.  Don’t think you’ve won because I’ve said I won’t fight, you haven’t, the outcome will be the same for you.   I suppose it’s just semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">It's been two weeks since my last chemo.&lt;p&gt;Things have been slowly getting back to normal.  I’ve watched the bairns swimming lessons and Imogen’s gymnastics for the first time in months.  I’ve watched them play rugby in the freezing cold at the rugby club.  I’ve driven to the office.  I’ve had the Gin Club round for birthday drinks, and it’s been great.  But I’ve noticed that the fatigue is still hanging around.  If I have a busy day, the next day will normally involve a nap.  I’m still not sleeping well, so that’s having an impact.  But it’s going I the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been getting lots of messages of support.  They really do mean a lot to Ross and I.  I have to admit being disappointed in some people, but have to accept everyone will react in different ways to this sort of thing.  We are relying on a lot of support at the minute, and in the words of Billy Ocean, “When the going gets tough, the tough get going.”  Thank you to everyone who has helped out, in any way, shape or form.  It’s very much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in other news, it’s my Dad’s birthday today.  Happy birthday Dad. X&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I've spent so long trying to be strong and positive, I've surprised myself a little bit today by giving in to The Fear.&lt;p&gt;The Fear that I’ll not beat this Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fear that if I beat it this time around that it’ll come back, and I won’t be able to fight it a second time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fear that I could die and not watch my bairns grow up into the fantastic people I know they will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fear of leaving Ross to handle things without me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent today in bed again today, too exhausted to do much except watch tv and read and I don’t doubt that The Fear is related to this exhaustion.  There’s been lots of tears.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I finished my first lot of chemotherapy today.  Yay!&lt;p&gt;I started my chemotherapy journey on November 20th with a drug called Docetaxel which I was supposed to have 4 times on a three week cycle.  4 days after having it for the first time, I was in A&amp;amp;E with undiagnosed chest pains.  My oncologist changed it to a drug called Paclitaxel which I was to have weekly for 9 weeks which finished today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so pleased, as I’m so tired.  I’m looking forward to having some energy back again.  I’m looking forward to being able to watch the bairns swimming lessons and their rugby practice.  I’m looking forward to Gin Club coffee mornings.  And I’m looking forward to going away as a family and spending some quality time together before Round Two starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round Two is the surgery which will take 4-6 weeks to recover from.  I had a good chat today with the Breast Care Nurse at the hospital and she gave me a lot of information about Post Surgery bras, prothesis, and how I can expect to to look and feel afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round Three is more chemotherapy.  This time a treatment called FEC which is three different drugs.  I’ll have 3 or 4 of these treatments on a three week cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round Four will be 15-18 daily sessions of radiotherapy at a hospital in North West London.  We don’t have a hospital which is convenient for this treatment which is a bit of a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline of all of this is taking us to July/August time.  It’s quite epic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to have my Herceptin treatment every three weeks, so I’ll have another one of those on March 7th.  A slightly longer gap after surgery, with a break for FEC and starting again afterwards for another 7-10 treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I need to restart my 5-10 year course of Hormone therapy which has been stopped in the interim.  I’m quite glad as it causes horrid hot flushes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, none of this is actually set in stone.  What I know for sure is that all the rounds are happening, and in which order.  What we don’t know is exactly when.  The results of the genetic screening could dictate more radical surgery, and that may not happen on March 24th which is when it’s provisionally booked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross and I have come to realise that having control of your life and having the ability to make plans is just an illusion.  We’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath us and we can’t really see more than 5 weeks ahead.  In fact, I can’t make plans for next week as I don’t know how tired this last lot of chemo will make me.  The illusion has been shattered and you can never tell what is round the corner to throw you off balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’ve got to be positive and be glad that we’ve got each other in our little family.  Imogen and a Felix got glowing reports from their teachers at parents evening and Ross and I are so proud.  With everything that is going in, they still manage to be normal kids, doing normal things at school.  I love them to the moon and back.  Their resilience awes me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are lucky to have the support of good friends who understand how even the simplest  things can make all the difference.  And Creme Eggs.  They really do make a difference (although my waistline isn’t thanking me!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s looking forward to a brief return to normality. And my birthday which is on Tuesday.  And a Gin a Club a Girls Night In.  I’m really looking forward to that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I would have written this post before now, but the chemo session I had on Friday has had me pretty much bed bound for 4 days.&lt;p&gt;Ross went to Dublin on Monday 2nd Feb, and at lunchtime my Dad arrived to steer the Lawley ship in his absence.  He did a super job of making sure the kids, cats and I  were fed and watered, the bairns got to and from school and after school groups on time, and kept the litter tray tidy.  He also found time to do a few DIY jobs round the house and garden.  I was chauffeured to my hospital appointments and he sat with me when I had my chemo.  I wasn’t much company, as soon as they give me the Piriton, I fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Ross hopped over the Atlantic to New York for a couple of days, and late Friday I had word he was on his way home.  He arrived back to us just as Dad was taking the bairns to their swimming lesson on Saturday morning.  I was sad when Dad left on Saturday afternoon, but realise Julie needs him too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so lucky to have two utterly dependable men in my life.  Thank you Dad, thank you Ross.  (And thank you Julie for letting me borrow him for a short while.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Dublin and New York in a week.&lt;p&gt;Its been a week, lots of travel and catching up with people from work. Its been great, its been tough, its been fun and at times it sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dublin&quot;&gt;Dublin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to see folks in the office - last time I was there was before the bump turned out to be cancer. There was lots of “how’s Julia?” which was a double edged sword, describing what has happening in the last few months again and again took its toll but equally it was good as showed that people care. I wasn’t overly in a drinking mood so I ducked out of the big drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On tuesday it was the european company meeting, which was both fun and informative.  In the afternoon there was a Casino Royale social - brilliantly cheesy and fun. I played blackjack for hours, made and lost millions and somehow I still managed to sneak onto the final winners table and ended up coming third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some chance that a snow storm would disrupt travel to New York, it did but only by an hour.  Julia and I were secretly hoping that my flight would be cancelled and I could come home…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-york&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York was cold, a snow storm had hit earlier in the week it was still snowy.  I enjoyed a walk round central park Thursday morning before a day of meetings. Time went quickly and it was soon time to head on home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the taxi to the airport, I suddenly realised I had left my passport in the hotel safe. PANIC. I’m such an idiot. Luckily, I always leave loads of time to get to the airport and we had time to turn round and head back to the hotel.  Friday evening in Manhattan isn’t the best time for traffic, so it took what felt like an age. At one point I left the taxi with all my bags in it and ran a couple of blocks to the hotel to get my passport.  By the time I got it, the taxi was out front of the hotel and we headed off to the airport. All in all it cost me an extra hour but I made it to the airport with time to spare and once through security I had a beer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning and I finally made it back home! Thanks to Mike for looking after Julia.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">This week has had both good and bad parts - rollercoaster does it justice.&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting in Terminal 1 at Heathrow waiting for a flight to Dublin for a couple of days of meetings and then I’m off to New York for a couple more. I’m ridiculously early for my flight as I managed to get a lift from Dan rather than fighting through 3 different trains during rush hour.  Thanks Dan, your knowledge of the eddies and flow of the M25 traffic is impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I’ve aged a lot in the last week and yesterday there were tears. The difference a week off chemo has made is huge, Julia has had some energy this last week and that’s been great. We’ve needed it mind as she’s been to see 4 different consultants.  Julia has been stressing about not knowing what’s happening after chemo, which was initially due to finish this week but as she missed one its next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s next?  That has been the question and is seems not even the consultants knew. The thing is there is no road map, no 12 steps, no single way of killing cancer. The chemo doctor was pondering if we should do more chemo -&amp;gt; surgery -&amp;gt; radiotherapy and hormone therapy or surgery -&amp;gt; radiotherapy -&amp;gt; more chemo and hormone therapy. So to help decide he arranged Julia to have a scan and then meet the surgeon to see what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre surgery chemo is the exception rather than the rule. Julia also had her chemo drugs in a different order than the “normal way”. We found out why, it was because Julia’s cancer was growing fast and the position of it that meant that she had to have chemo first and the big drugs first.  When Julia had her scan when we heard that the original size of the cancer was 8cm and has shrunk to 1cm. We both agree that we’re bloody glad we didn’t find out that nugget earlier on, it would have scared the bejebus out of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a train to London (to Harley street no less) to see the genetics doctor. His office was bigger than my front room - epic. The upshot of it is Julia is being tested but the results won’t necessarily be conclusive or provide a boolean yes or no about what to do in the future. It raised a few questions but we’ll look at them more when and if we have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surgeon saw Julia and really wanted to take a lead from what she wanted. Julia joked that she just wants to be told when to turn up.  There was some discussion about what to do. Julia has had a great response to chemo and there may even be a complete pathological response and all cancer cells killed. The surgeon discussed a 1990’s clinical trial where people who had such responses didn’t have a mastectomy and all were clear after 5 years.  Julia and I both sat there not wanting to be told that there would be no surgery - as we’d just live with a cloud of fear over our heads. Anyway, no need as the surgeon went on to say that none made a 10 year clear, which confirmed his belief in cutting out the problem. A date is booked for surgery - 24th March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we’ve had such an amount of information this week, that its been mentally tough. Tension levels have been up as away this week.  I enjoyed a well earned pint on Saturday but could have done without the hangover on Sunday.  Julia cried Sunday morning not wanting me to go and then later apologised for crying.  Imogen blew up when asked to write out her times tables and then when I tried to get her to calm down I lost it after she started pushing me in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so ashamed of scaring her when I shouted at her that I started sobbing. The dam broke and the powerlessness of it all struck home hard. I had a five minute breakdown and just sobbed. I had just realised that for all the hoping and belief that I could somehow help my children through this unscathed. I now know I can’t and this horrible disease is hurting my children also. It’s a hard realisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing probably is not to set unrealistic expectations but emotions and beliefs aren’t known for being rational.  Although, my emotions are still a little raw (the last paragraph was incredibly difficult to write) I think the good thing is the realisation.  My next steps will be working out how to minimise the impact and help ensure the kids are rounded. The only thing is I’m not sure how best to do that… Once I return home from Dublin and New York I’ll look into it more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be a long week, so please keep an eye on Julia whilst I’m away and thanks Grandad Mikey for stopping over for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I've seen 4 different consultants this week, at three different hospitals. I've had scans, blood tests, as well as regular chemo.  And I'm tired now.&lt;p&gt;I’ve felt so much better this week than I have done of late.  I’ve felt my energy slowly drain from me, so having a week off treatment has just meant I’m able to recharge my batteries that bit more.  Luckily, having all my appointments in a good week meant I’m not completely wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, I saw my oncologist who was trying to decide what the next step will be.  Either surgery or another lot of chemo.  He suggested I have another scan and speak to the surgeon.  I was a bit thrown by the extra chemo course and the fact that the next step was not definite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, we tipped off to London, to see a Genetic Oncologist.  I was tested for the BRCA Gene to see if this cancer is genetic.  I’ll find out in 4-6 weeks.  Fingers crossed it comes back negative, as I don’t want my Imogen or any potential granddaughters to have to go through this.  It’s not very pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then the usual round of blood tests on Thursday returning on Friday for my chemo.  After that I was scanned.  The good news is the Big Lump has shrunk to about 10mm.  I asked how big it was in October.  8cm.  8cm!  Just let that sink in for a minute.  8cm.  But it’s responded very well to the chemo, so I’m not going to dwell on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with this information, the surgeon decided that the next step will be surgery.  A radical modified mastectomy and further node clearance.  The date is set for 24th March.  This is 5 weeks after this phase of chemo finishes to give me a chance to recover and get back to health.  It’ll also hopefully give us a chance to maybe go away for a short holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been quite down this week before today, as I’ve found it difficult not knowing what is going to happen, and the realisation, I’ll be subjected to another 3 cycles of chemotherapy.  But now that I have a firm date to aim for, I feel a bit happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting is the amazing friends I have.  I’ve been given Creme Eggs, Cakes, Brownies, meatballs, and a freezer full on dinners.  So big shout out to Clair, Arwen, Heather, Lesley, Michelle and the rest of the Gin Club ladies.  We are so thankful to you all for childcare help, the supportive messages, and also realising that I needed a boost.  You all rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross is away with work next week, so, as I can’t be trusted on my own, my Dad is coming to stay to look after me, the bairns and the cat.  Hate to tell you dad, but you’re on cat litter tray duty.  I can’t, you see, risk of infection. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s this weeks update.  Ups and downs as usual. But keeping on, keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I thought rather than the normal diary approach I'd step back and reflect.&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been finding myself reflecting on things.  It could just be the time of the year - a new year and all that, or it could just be my brain trying to make sense of the madness of it all.  Either way, I hope it helps and in the future when memories have faded, it will shine a light on thoughts in the eye of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;julia&quot;&gt;Julia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia is a star. She’s generally been dealing with a weekly dose of poison with such amazing courage and stoicism to it.  However, it has been so hard to observe the bone crushing fatigue that it brings.  Chemotherapy, each week takes a higher toll on her. It’s probably the wrong way round, the toll is the same but the acculation of it means it’s been taking longer and longer to recover.  So much so, this week they postponed her weekly chemotherapy, to give her a chance to recover before starting again next week.  The result was Julia was able to get out of bed and do things with the kids by herself on Saturday. Something, that hasn’t happened for months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both are looking forward to the end of chemotherapy but it’s also scary, there’s the next stage of the journey to go and we aren’t even 100% of what that will fully entail. It’s probably best not to know - too much information and all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-kids&quot;&gt;The kids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both kids are doing well but unsurprisingly Imogen has been hit the hardest.  There’s been tears and tantrums from them both, but with Imogen there’s just more. More anger, more bitterness, more shouting and more tears.  She has woken scared, wanting to read the Mummys Lump book, which helps reassure her of the future. She’s become territorial of her room and once she feels aggrieved, it takes time and space for her to calm down.  It’s difficult if she decides to do that just before the school run and all stress levels rise.  Felix, for the most part seems to be taking it all in his stride, he’s had a couple of moments mind. Felix is having nightmares and there have been a couple of nighttime accidents, so even though he might not understand exactly whats happening it still is impacting him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;me&quot;&gt;Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still scared about the future, there have been times I’ve woken in the middle of the night for no real reason, but I’m not the type of person who dwells on things too much. Although, I’ve come to absolutely &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; fridays. It’s the worst day of the week by far and it impacts me alot. I have a trifecta of pressure that simmers throughout the day - getting the kids to and from school, trying to get my work done and watching Julia go from being the best she has been for a week to being floored. It really is the crappiest of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to say I’m handling being chief laundry man well - mind I haven’t done any ironing this year but as there’s only two items in the ironing pile who cares!  I’m generally very busy, but I’m now used to it. I can get grumpy when I don’t get much time to sit and chill at weekends but on the whole I’m busy and happy to be so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janathon and Dryathlon have been fun and are a good distraction. The only downside is the month feels soo long! How can it &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; be Janurary?!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">My chemotherapy has had a holiday this week.&lt;p&gt;Things seemed to be going ok.  Granted the extreme fatigue I’ve been feeling has been quite frustrating and I’ve had a headache which I’ve been unable to shift, but it was ‘Fine’.  Unfortunately things weren’t to stay on an even keel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d managed to deploy some new functionality for work which had been playing on my mind.  This was a relief.  Small wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to the hospital every Thursday to have blood tests to check I’m fit enough to have my chemo on Fridays.  It doesn’t take long and I’m normally dealt with quickly and efficiently allowing me to get back to work.  This Thursday, however, I woke up feeling distinctly under par, and whilst Ross was taking the bairns to breakfast club, I was subsequently sick.  Not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about having chemotherapy, is everything is taken very seriously.  So when I mentioned I’d been sick and had a headache, things started happening.  I had additional blood tests taken, blood pressure, temperature, the doctor came in and had a look at me, and then we waited for the blood test results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking we wouldn’t be there for long, Ross hadn’t taken his laptop, so was unable to do any work.  I, however, made good use of the situation, and went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few of hours, the blood tests results came back, and then we had to wait for my Consultant to make a decision.  He was eventually tracked down, and decided that given how exhausted I was, I’d have a week off my chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this decision made, we went off home with some anti sickness tablets, and I went to bed and went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the break in chemo, it coincided with a week I was due my Herceptin, so we still had to go back for that on Friday morning.  Luckily this is a quick 30 min drip, so we were out quite quickly.  I was also instructed to see the GP about my headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back home, back to bed, and although I was tempted to go to the drs in my PJs, I did manage to get dressed to attend my appointment.  I was given some stronger painkillers and told to return if things didn’t improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning comes, and Ross does the usual round of ferrying the bairns to their swimming lessons and dancing for Imogen.  I’d managed to change Felix’s lesson, so he was back with his old teacher and as a result didn’t go into melt down when it was time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some gorgeous flowers delivered whilst the family were out from my Dad and Julie, and like all flowers which are sent, they are very well received and much appreciated.  Flowers make me smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I’ve developed a slight case of Chemo induced agrophobia.  I just don’t want to go out unless I really have to.  I had planned to go for a walk to the knitting shop, but I got sidetracked baking with Imogen, and have to say, I wasn’t too disappointed.  We made fruit burst muffins and banana bread, and although the oven proved a bit tricky to decipher, they were lovely. (http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1273/fruitburst-muffins)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the painkillers kicking in, and a bit of respite from the chemo, I felt well enough to have a glass of Sparkly from my Gin Club supply.  I did worry that Ross would feel like I wasn’t supporting him with Dryathlon, but he understood that it was one glass, and I probably wouldn’t feel like having anymore until I finish my chemo in 4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning, the bairns go to their second rugby training session, and Ross gets them signed up as members of the rugby club.  I stay at home, and make sure there’s plenty of hot water on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headache persists, but I’m trying to stay on top of it with the painkillers.  I’m hoping that with a break in treatment, the fatigue is going to release it’s holds me so that I can become a facsimile of a fully functioning human being.  Temporarily at least.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Imogen decided she would like to put a post on the blog so we can see things from her perspective&lt;p&gt;I’m worried about Mummy because she having horrible medicine.  She needs to have this to make her better from the Cancer.  I’m angry and cross and sometimes sad.  Mummy keeps reading Mummy’s Lump to me and it makes me feel a bit happier because it tells us what is happening in words I can understand.  It’s helping me understand what is going to happen to Mummy and it makes me feel less scared.  It’s hard to understand everything that is happening at the minute, but the book helps me a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mummy has no hair because she has strong medicine called Chemotherapy.  I went to the hospital to see Mummy have her Chemotherapy over the Christmas holidays, and I thought it was going to be scary, but it wasn’t.  All it was, was bags of medicine which looked like water, going through a tube, into Mummy.  It didn’t hurt Mummy, but she did fall asleep.  I read a Hello Kitty book and Felix and Daddy made a Lego object.  Then we watched Gangster Granny on Daddy’s iPad. Then we watched Katie Morag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week after that, we went to Katy’s house whilst Mummy had her Chemotherapy.  I was much happier with this because it was less boring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mummy doesn’t go swimming anymore because the Chemotherapy makes her tired and she just wants to go to sleep.  I’m looking forward to her finishing it, so we can have more time with Mummy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m scared about the operation Mummy is going to have but it’s a while away.  After the operation, Mummy might have to have Radiotherapy that kills any little bits of Lump that are left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to be doing the Race For Life in July for Cancer Research, and I am looking forward to it.  A lot of my friends are going to do it with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mummy still loves her cuddles with me and Felix.  And I love them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">We always knew this journey was going to have it's ups and downs, but I think we've been quite lucky with it so far.&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that there’s not a lot going on, because we’ve still had the weekly blood tests, followed by chemo, but there’s been less high adrenaline activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, feeling like I had fair wind behind me, I decided that on Tuesday I’d drive the 22 miles to the office to show my face.  Although I’ve been working my normal four days a week, they’ve been at home, with my laptop.  If I need a nap, I can have one, and the commute is as involved as walking to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely underestimated how much the normal morning routine would take out of me.  Getting the bairns up and dressed, getting my breakfast and lunch sorted, getting the bairns to breakfast club, driving to work.  By the time I was sat at my desk, I was shattered.  It was great to see people, and I appreciate some times a face to face conversation can save a lot of emails, but I certainly paid for it.
By 3pm, I was struggling to keep my eyes open, so at 4pm I left.  Once home, I had a bath and went to bed.  Unfortunately, despite being tired to the bottom of my boots, I found it very difficult to sleep.  The result being that come Wednesday morning, I was completely unable to get out of bed.  I thought after an hour or so’s extra rest, I’d be able to get the laptop out and start working again, but no.  I just couldn’t do it.  I felt so low and useless and miserable.  I admit, I had a little cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a pep talk from The Gin Club and a cuddle from Ross, I felt better but still spent the rest of the day in bed, only getting up to find sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday nights sleep was much better, and on Thursday morning, we tipped off to the hospital for my Pre-Chemo blood tests.  On the way, I checked my phone, and found I had won a pair of earrings in a Facebook competition.  This was just the boost I needed.  It was going to be a good day.  And it was.  I was glad to get back to work once we got back from the hospital, and put in a good solid block of time getting lots of ticks on my to do list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesley, kindly provided a home made pie for tea (thank you Lesley), and it was time to spend some time with my bairns,  I do feel like they haven’t been getting the best of me of late. I don’t think there is a best of me to have at the moment, but once the chemo is over with, I’m hoping to get fighting fit again so I can remind them what it’s like to have a normal mummy, before I get hit with the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">On Wednesday, we were at two different hospitals.&lt;p&gt;I saw the Oncologist in the morning to have a review of my treatment.    Despite my cold he was happy to continue.  I mentioned my chest was tight and was feeling a bit breathless so it was decided that I’d have a CT scan to rule out the possibility of a blood clot on my lung.  This is a risk of having the port which I have fitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the afternoon we went to another hospital for the CT scan.  This is the downside of going private.  Things aren’t all in one place.  Still, we’ve been given fantastic care, wherever we’ve been treated.  We later hear, that it’s not a blood clot, and we are relieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, we return for my Chemo, and I sleep for the duration of the treatment.  Once home, I sleep some more, only getting up once the bairns are home from school so Ross can attend some work meetings online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend was quiet for me.  I got lots of rest and only ventured out to see if Felix could remember how to ride his bike.  He hadn’t. It was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the level of Chemo induced fatigue has surprised me and Ross.  I feel wiped out for most of the time.  I find it frustrating, so Ross must too.  I’m so lucky to have him and think he’s wonderful.  I’ve said it before, and will say it again, he rocks, and is my Rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s signed up for Dryathlon &amp;amp; Janathlon and I know he’s finding it tough, but he’s raised a lot of money for Cancer Research, which is a cause very important to us at the moment.  Stay Strong Ross.  You can do it. X&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">It's been a tough old week that's left me physically and emotionally drained.&lt;p&gt;Work started and I’ve missed it! I’m lucky that I love programming and get paid to do it. After a while of being away from keyboard I start to get twitchy, so I managed to get back into it quickly. I have a new monitor that is epic and also makes working from home much easier. I’ve now ordered a new IKEA Lack coffee table and shelf and soon my standing desk will be complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed into the office on Tuesday and got a keyboard and trackpad for home. It was good to catch up with people, some which I haven’t seen since Julia’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, we had an appointment to see the chemo doctor. We have been on tender hooks since New Years about illness, Julia has had a sore throat and we are worried it will head to her chest. The dr wasn’t happy that Julia was reporting some breathing and chest pains so he booked her in for a ct scan just to rule out a blood clot caused by her port. He was 80% sure it was just a viral infection but it was best to rule it out. We headed off to Spire in the afternoon and had the scan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we slept well on Thursday night, pre chemo nights cause Julia to be restless. Friday comes and we’re both knackered, we get the kids to school and head off to the hospital again. Julia’s bloods are ok, red cells are still low so more beef and greens next week! Julia sleeps for most of the chemo as the piriton knocks her out and I work away. Time soon passes and we head home. Julia sleeps a lot on chemo days and I stress about getting work done, picking the kids up, cooking tea and getting Imogen to gymnastics. By bedtime I’m knackered stressed and feeling low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the stress is doing Janathon and Dryathlon, finding time to exercise and sort everything can be hard also there have been times I could kill a beer! There is still time to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justgiving.com/Ross-Lawley-dryathlete&quot;&gt;sponsor me&lt;/a&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning I take the kids swimming, Imogen has her lesson first, then Felix and once done we have to hot foot it to Imogen’s dance class in Letchworth. Imogen does her part but after 30 mins of swimming with Felix he suddenly decides he’s not doing his lesson. No warning just point blank refused, arms crossed and face set. I argue that he has to but he screams when I pick him up to get him nearer to the class. It’s not like he won’t enjoy it once he gets in… Then when the teacher (Amy) picks him up and brings him over to the class he screams again. I leave him so he can join in, but after 15 mins after the lesson was supposed to start he’s still standing there I collect him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not best pleased about things and the waste of money, I tell Felix he’s lost lego Star Wars rights and he won’t go to rugby until he does a swimming lesson. I’m fuming and it takes me a while to cool down. That afternoon, we decide Felix can go to rugby if he rides his bike. Disaster! We head to the park and Felix refuses to pedal. Both Julia and I try to coax him and we both nearly binned his bike. The mission for Felix to be able to win back rugby failed miserably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cook a beef Wellington for tea to keep Julia’s bloods healthy. We’ve started doing meal plans for the week and click and collect at the super market in a bid to reduce the waste and save money. Everyone enjoys it and I’m told I’ll be cooking it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night Imogen wobbles at bedtime, she’s worried about mummy’s cancer and wants to read Mummy’s Lump, the book we were given to explain things to the children. Felix goes to bed much more quietly than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m worn out but can’t sleep, the fallout from my old blog post still goes on. Julia isn’t happy about being drawn into it and doesn’t want to ignore that and I support her. My parents ask about coming over in April to support after the surgery, and I’ve been putting off responding because as things stand it would be too stressful, it’s heartbreaking. Its been a shitty week but tomorrow is another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday is bright and crisp, Felix had an accident in the night so first order of duty is to shower him and wash the kids bedding. Then I head to the gym and feel much better after. I love fresh frosty bright days. After breakfast Imogen decides she wants to make mini cheesecakes. We head out to the shops, then she makes them, she rocks and makes awesome lime cheesecakes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch I take the kids out on bikes again, Felix is up for it today. I don’t let him walk with his bike to the park but get him to pedal whilst I push him. He wants to walk a couple of times but I don’t let him. We have fun and get to the park quickly. Felix is a different person today, he finds peddling hard but tries and succeeds. Lots of praise. He has a great time and I find a little grass ramp for Imogen to cycle down, she’s a dare devil and is brilliant. She falls off the ramp but gets straight back on. Felix has a go at cycling on the path and finds it easier. He’s nearly self sufficient, mission successful, he is going to rugby next week. Some good headology has got him past the finish line and he’s pleased as punch and  tells Julia when he gets home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week will be a better week.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Well a brief hiatus is always going to be a good sign on this blog!&lt;p&gt;Christmas has been bloody fantastic! I’ve feasted and drank with family and friends it’s been great. I went out for drinks with the Gin Club Dads (the Gin Club is the nick name for my wife’s friends, it’s a long story but basically they all had bairns (babies) at about the same time and used to have coffee mornings. One of the dad’s glibly said they just sit and drink gin and the Gin Club name stuck) it was a messy night for some reason we attacked the spirits and had all manner of evil shots. I could hardly function the next day and started to feel decidedly ropey whilst swimming with the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandad Mickey and grandma Julie were great company over Christmas. Grandma was almost annoyed he kids didn’t wake early enough on Christmas morning! I cooked my first Christmas dinner, it was a little late as we decided to have a quick Christmas pint at The Orange Tree but that helped reduce the stress of it and it was a great feast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Friday after Christmas (27th) the kids came with us for Julia’s chemo, it was good for them to see the process and see it’s not scary. It was slightly manic as it was blood tests in the morning then chemo in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, I took the bairns for a long walk round Weston Hills, we took a pack lunch as 7.5km is a trek for a 5 &amp;amp; 7 year old. Half way round we got shot at, as we stumbled upon a pheasant shoot. We had lunch whilst we waited for the all clear whistle and watched as some birds made it and others showered us in feathers and landed with a thud. Once the whistle sounded we spoke to some of the beaters as I showed the kids the birds, Felix is up for pheasant and Imogen turned vegetarian!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday Julia was feeling well enough to meet for a Gin Club walk round Ivel Springs.  It was good to see everyone and get some fresh air, afterwards, we all went to The Orange Tree to see the steam rally that was there, there were some fantastic machines steaming and chuffing away. The pub session lasted much longer than the walk and we left well oiled. The Martins and the Kings came back for some SingStar and pizza, the kids played together brilliantly and it was a late one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On New Year’s Eve we had a few friends over for a curry, I had planned the meals whilst hungover and seemed to go over the top, chicken tikka drumsticks, chicken korma, lamb kofta curry, golden saag potatoes and cauliflower, saffron rice and homemade naans. By the time the guests arrived I was knackered but it was a good night! And all the food evaporated - a good sign. I also ended up with loads of beer which is ironic as I’m going dry for January!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Year’s Day it was the start of Janathon (doing exercise every day in January). I took Imogen out for a 20 minute run, she did brilliantly and although the wind and rain gave her an ice cream headache we soldiered on and diverted attention from that by jumping in all the puddles!  Julia had to rest up a lot for that afternoon as we were round a friends for the best beef dinner I will have in 2014. Amazing. Good food and great company as always. When Julia looked knackered and was zoning out we said our goodbyes and headed home. The kids wanted to stay longer but we have been pushing our luck with our recent excursions and we have to make sure Julia stays fit and well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking Julia for her blood test we have a quiet day, the kids are tired and boy child manages to flood the downstairs loo by leaving taps on. Amazing considering a few hours before girl child got a rollicking for leaving the tap on and nearly doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are back at the hospital now, the nurse wasn’t happy with Julia and a doctor was called. No temp but a sore throat, after checking her chest she gets the all clear for chemo. As I say we have been pushing our luck recently and Julia is on strict instructions to rest up extra this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy new year all!&lt;/p&gt;
