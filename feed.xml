  <content type="html">On Saturday night, Ross and I go out.  Out!&lt;p&gt;The town where we live, is a quirky old place.  There are several festivals that run during the year, one of which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firesidefestival.org/&quot;&gt;The Fireside Festival.&lt;/a&gt;  It’s a Storytelling Festival, and Ross and I decide to give it a go and see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anarchistcook.info/&quot;&gt; George Egg: Anarchist Cook.&lt;/a&gt;  The premise is a man who cooks a three course meal, in an hour, using items commonly found in a hotel room.  It was good, it was funny, but I got Wobbly Head again.  I wish I didn’t get it.  Ross and Michelle both noticed that I got Wobbly Head half way through the show.  Still, I persevered, and afterwards we went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theorangetreebaldock.com/&quot;&gt;The Orange Tree&lt;/a&gt; for a quick drink.  However, after just one, I was ready to come home. I was conscious I needed to take my evening medication, so Ross walked me home, sorted my meds and then he went back out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, that I had a little cry.  It was Saturday night, we had a babysitter, we had a legitimate reason to go out.  But I just didn’t have the energy.  It just didn’t seem fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I took myself off to bed, and with the help of the sleeping pills, I was off to the Land of Nod, and soon enough woken up with cuddles from the bairns on Mother’s Day.  They had made me some lovely hand made cards, the top one in the picture being from Imy.  The the bottom right is a list of things that make me a good mum according to Felix,  I’m particularly pleased with the Bedroom Tidier - I had rather hoped that they would be doing it themselves by now, but they obviously appreciate the help.  The glass cat makes me smile.  They know me well.  Crazy Cat Lady!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mothersday.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mothers Day Gift and Cards&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, (not in bed, as that would make too many crumbs and I want to spend the time with the family), I decide to go to the rugby club and catch up with the news from there.  It was good to see people who I hadn’t seen for a while, and we also see the smiley faces of the kids as they came in from their training session covered in mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tacklemonster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tackle Monster&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick sprint (as much as you can with a stick) round the supermarket, once home, I was told to go and enjoy a Mother’s Day nap.   Which I did.  Very much so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Mather’s Day to all you lovely Mum’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Once home, life starts to settle, into the new, new normal.&lt;p&gt;The day after I return home, Dad decides that it’s time for him to go back home, and I have to admit, Julie needs him more than I do now.  I don’t want to be greedy, he’s spent so much time with us, and for that I will be eternally grateful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have more visitors cross the threshold, and I begin to start to go out and do normal things again.  I watch Felix’s swimming lesson, I go to the supermarket, just normal things.  Normal things are good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday evening, I manage to pull off the biggest coup to date.  And that was to return to choir.  I only managed the first half of the session as I found it difficult to keep up with the pace of things, but I enjoyed it, and I’m really glad I went. After an hour, I start to get what I call Whirly Eyes and Wobbly Head.  This is where my eyes start to roll back in their sockets, or where I can’t keep my head held up.  Everyone gets it at some point or another but they are more frequent for me these days.  Luckily, Tash gives me a lift home, and hopefully, all things being equal, I’ll be there again next week, failing that, the week after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to be well enough to sing in a couple of concerts this Spring/Summer.  Fingers Crossed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx   &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Home again, Home again, Jiggity Jig!&lt;p&gt;On Monday the Hospice have the Multi-Disciplinary team meeting, and it’s here that they decide what they are going do with me.  After discussions with me about my pain control, the doctors and nurses decide that they are going to aim to get me home for Wednesday.  This is great news!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having such lot of food at my party, Tracey’s Magnificent Bombay Sapphire Birthday Cake was donated to the Hospice so that the in-patients could have a piece with their Monday afternoon tea, distributed by the volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cake2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bombay Sapphire Birthday Cake&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These volunteers, who give their own time up to help out, are without doubt a priceless resource, one that Letchworth and Baldock should be proud of.  One evening I found myself having my water changed by one of my neighbours.  Funny who you bump into - in the most unexpected of places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the cake had been distributed to anyone who wanted a piece (and it was decreed to be delicious by all), the rest was taken home and the kids and Grandad devoured the remainder very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening I had a meeting with my Oncologist who has decided to change my Hormone therapy tablets.  The biopsy on my spine, had confirmed that the tumour was ER+ which meant that the Tamoxifen hadn’t been doing it’s job properly.  So, I’m to switch to another hormone therapy which involves a monthly injection, and different hormone therapy tablets.  The injection is called Zoladex, and has to be done monthly by a nurse at my GP’s surgery and tablets, taken daily, are called Anastrozole for those that are interested.  The nuisance is, that had they taken out both ovaries in the Oophorectomy and Cystectomy I had in May, then this would be one part of therapy I wouldn’t have to worry about.  But, here we are, this is what we have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after lots of visits from lots of lovely people, it was soon Wednesday morning and I was sent home with enough prescription drugs to fill an pharmacy and instructions that if I felt any worse, to go back if I felt any changes for the worse.  Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mam had come down to see me, and we caught up over a coffee at a local coffee shop.  I think she was glad to see that I didn’t look very ill on the surface, and was in fact quite normal and like my old self, keeping on, keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Great Fun, Great Friends, Great Gin!&lt;p&gt;In the run up to the Mini Gin Festival, I had a few things to do to make sure things went off well.  Thankfully I could rely on Fiona to pretty much run the show, but I did want to get involved in a few things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to sort out getting enough vintage crockery for 20 people.  Luckily for me, a couple of years ago, through the magic of social media, I met a marvelous lady called Jenny, online who happens to own
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/THE.GREEN.HOUSE.MARKET/?fref=ts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Green House Community Market&lt;/a&gt; in Letchworth.  She was having treatment for breast cancer at the time I was restoring some furniture, (which was on my Bucket List),  and needed some help with the paint and method.  She was a star and helped me out massively.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Green House is an Aladdin’s cave for retro, vintage and antique furniture and accessories, and I was able to go in with Rachel on Friday and select the crockery we wanted.  We also had a mooch around a little shop to buy a few bits and bobs to go on my new book shelf, but again, it wasn’t too long before I was feeling fatigued and ready to return to the Igloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another morning and afternoon of rest, it was time for me to get ready for my party.  Fiona had done a fabulous job in getting things prepared.  The other partygoers got into the vintage tea party spirit, and made lovely cakes, sandwiches, mini quiches and other delicious little morsels in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/goodies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cakes&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tea.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tea&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we arrive,  we were all lucky enough to have our photo’s taken by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SimonBrooksPhotography&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Simon Brooks&lt;/a&gt; who took some amazing shots of us, some of which can been seen on his Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/juliafiona.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Julia &amp;amp; Fiona&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/party.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Party&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of how the Mini Gin Festival started can be found here:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://teamrj.co.uk/articles/gin-kindness/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gin of Human Kindness&lt;/a&gt;.  And it at this point that we must mention Katie at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/hurrahforgin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hurrah For Gin&lt;/a&gt; as without her, the #ginforjulia thing would never have happened, and we would never have been able to put on such a fantastic Mini Festival.  Katie, you rock. x&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Party was fantastic, I had such a good time, and the donations we received via the #ginforjulia hashtag on social media meant the party was a huge success.  It was a shame I couldn’t have a small Gin, but I am determined that once the pain has settled and I am on fewer painkillers, I’ll be able to try a gin…or two!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pinkster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Local Pinkster Gin&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who was involved in the party, either helping me celebrate, or for making a donation.  I appreciate it all.  My birthday cake, made by Tracey was a particular hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  <content type="html">A brilliant, fantastic experience.&lt;p&gt;I had been instructed that Saturday was my strict day of rest.  I was not to leave the Igloo at all in preparation for Sunday’s Birthday Party.  Lesley came to visit with some jeans I’d asked her to buy for me, and then Fiona came round with Jess to organise some party bags, a surprise for our party guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ross, my Dad, and the bairns it was a different matter.  Imogen and Felix had won a competition to be Mascots for The Saracens, their favourite premiership Rugby Union team.  The game was on Saturday afternoon, at their home game to Gloucester.   It was a minor fixture in the great scheme of rugby premiership games, but to them it was the best game of the season.  They were given a tour of the tunnel and changing rooms, and when the time came they accompanied a player onto the pitch before the game.  They had such a good time and were buzzing with excitement when they came to tell me about it all afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I&#39;m going to party like it&#39;s my Birthday!&lt;p&gt;I was adamant I wasn’t going to be in the Igloo for my birthday.  In the end, I didn’t really have a choice.  My pain wasn’t under control, and I was regularly having to top up what they were giving me. I had been to the Spire in Harpenden the day before to start my Herceptin and Zometra treatment, and on the afternoon I hoped to be sent home, I spent asleep fatigued from the excursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan had been for me to go out for a Birthday Cream Tea at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/TeaatTapps/?fref=ts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tea at Tapps&lt;/a&gt;.   I’ve been there a few times and am always impressed with their wonderful range of teas, coffees, and cakes.  Ross picked me up from the Igloo and took me to meet the bairns and Grandma and Grandad to have out birthday cream tea.  It was delicious.  My only grumble is that the scones aren’t big enough, but that’s the steroids talking…I’m sure they are the perfect size for a normal person!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt very lucky, and overwhelmed with the amount of cards and presents I received.    After a wander around the gift shop and garden centre, I was sent back to the Igloo with strict instructions to sleep as Ross and I were going out that night for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross collected me from the Igloo,  all dressed up and ready to go, and then after dropping the car off at home, my Dad took us to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thegeorgeatbaldock.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The George&lt;/a&gt;  for a fine dining spectacular.  I enjoyed being out with Ross, spending some quality time with him in a non- medical setting.  However, I quickly started to feel very fatigued, so much so we didn’t manage a pudding.  You know things are serious when I can’t manage a pudding!
The starter and main meal were delicious and all in all we were out for about an hour, but it was a good hour, I enjoyed it.  Enjoyed being a normal couple with my husband.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">The word &#39;Hospice&#39; isn&#39;t really very user friendly.&lt;p&gt;Not for me anyway.  A Hospice is where people go to die.  So, when it was suggested to me by my Oncologist that I stay in a hospice, to say I wasn’t keen was an understatement!  However, my pain levels weren’t being managed and I needed something to happen to get back on track.  I had a conversation with Big Brother Callum on Wednesday, and I suggested that if the Hospice was called something else, I might be able to handle it a bit better.  So we coined the phrase ‘Igloo’.  You can leave an Igloo.  That’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is where Letchworth’s Garden House Hospice came in.  A small hospice, five minutes from my own home.  On the Thursday afternoon, I was admitted into my own little room, with a view of a lovely, cared for garden.  I met the nurses and a Doctor, and told them in no uncertain terms that I wouldn’t be staying for very long, maybe a day or two, and then I would be going home with my family.  Max was coming to see me on Saturday, and who would want to spend a day visiting someone in a Hospice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff nodded in agreement, went through my drugs list and I made myself comfortable.  The next day, Fiona and Michelle came to visit me in The Igloo.  Spirit’s were raised and I started to feel calmer about things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Max assured me that he was fine to visit me in the Igloo, so when he arrived, complete with souvenir mug from Cats the Musical, I was really pleased. He’d had a late night the night before, and an early start that morning to be be able to get the train to visit me from Manchester, so at one point, the nurses came in to find him asleep on the armchair in my room, and me asleep in my bed.  They just left us to it.  They were great like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days my opinion of the Igloo/Hospice changed substantially.  I hadn’t realised what other services they offer there.  We had support workers come in to us and offer counselling, not only to me, but to Ross and the kids.  They were given activity packs to keep them occupied as well as comfort quilts which were to be used as something that they would associate with a “safe place”.  There was a lounge next to my room so they didn’t have to spend all their time there looking at me feeling all sorry for myself.  Another massive thing that I hadn’t realised was that I wasn’t tied to the hospice.  I could come and go, as and when I wanted, as long as I was back in time for my medication.  This meant I was able to go to Rachel and Greg’s to watch the 6 Nation rugby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also able to greet Dad and Grandma Julie when they arrived at ours.  I had a little cry, and was taken back to what I had come to regard as my little oasis of calm, The Igloo.  As this was half term, we had planned on the kids going to stay up in the North East for a few days.  However, we decided that it would be best if Grandma and Grandad stayed at ours so the kids were able to visit me when they wanted, and they’d have some days out around me.  And crucially, get to see me on my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had plenty of visitors to the Igloo, as well as support from the staff.  I was still adamant that I was going to be home for my birthday, but after a week in the Igloo, I was still there, relinquishing control of things to the staff slowly but surely and starting to realise that BIG STUFF was happening and I couldn’t deal with it all on my own.  If I was still in the Igloo for my birthday, it didn’t matter.  I was, after all, Just Visiting, and Big Brother Callum made me a sign to make sure that I remembered that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning it was up and out to Mount Vernon Cancer Centre for the first of three Cyberknife treatments. The bairns were safely deposited at Fiona’s so she could take them to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traffic at that time in the morning on the A1 and M25 is horrid, and people are idiots. Luckily Ross did a super job of getting us there safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once there,  we had a quick chat with Dr Shah, my Oncologist, who told us that it could be 3-4 weeks before the pain in my back started to subside, and he was mindful that my painkiller meds aren’t quite doing the job.  He was going to speak to the Palliative nurse, Julia, who I’d seen on Monday,  with the intention of having a plan of action in place to best deal with my pain, by the time I’d finished the last treatment on Thursday.  All I want to be able to do is walk the kids to school in the morning.  Make their tea again.  Start to become a more useful member of Team Lawley!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cyberknifebed1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cyberknife Cradle&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have a great night’s sleep, so lying still, on a vacuum packed beanbag looking up at an artificial blue sky listening to music for an hour, whilst the scanner and robot do their stuff was quite appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cyberknifeready.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cyberknife Ready&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment didn’t hurt.  The robotic machine just moved around me and whirred, firing beams of radiation at me.  Nothing scary, nothing nasty, it just killed off bad cancer cells accurately.  All whilst I snoozed and listened to some music.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was the same.  Kids dropped off at Caroline’s, and I had the second of the third treatments.  All calm, all fine.  Nothing of any concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as is standard, we Keep on, Keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Macmillan Support&lt;p&gt;My GP had referred me on to the Community Palliative Care Specialists in order that we could tap into the information and services they have available to them.  Being under a Palliative Care team feels like a double edge sword.  On one side it’s great, they can give me pointers in what we need to do in terms of getting me out and about more by applying for a Blue Badge and also the short term hire of a wheelchair.  The other side to the sword is that whichever way I look at it, I have a Terminal Illness, Stage 4 cancer, and there is nothing anyone can do for that.  All we can do is manage the Cancer.  I will never be free from it, and I will always be living under the shadow or it.  (Even at this point now, I’m still waiting for someone to tell me there’s been a terrible mistake, and it’s a slipped disk.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that, Julia, the Palliative Care nurse was brilliant.  She was empathetic, and a great listener.  She gave us a hope that the pain I’m in will be short-term but the Cyberknife treatment can take 3-4 weeks to actually work.  She reviewed my current medication list, made some minor adjustments and gave us another prescription.  As I say, she’s a very knowledgeable person, another good one to have on my side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing she said to me was, and the thing I came away feeling most positive about was when she said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You are living with Cancer, not dying from Cancer”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-for-life&quot;&gt;Race for Life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Race For Life has been an event that I have enjoyed participating in for  years now.  I’ve done it 8 or 9 times, including last years Pretty Muddy spectacular.  It’s got a great atmosphere and people are very generous with their donations, it’s a good cause after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past two Race’s have happened around the time of Ross’s birthday, and have rather eclipsed it somewhat.  We had thought that this year we would miss the Race, or do a different one and concentrate on Ross and his birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we told Imy and Felix that my Cancer had come back, Imy immediately asked if she could do the Race again.  Felix was in agreement, and Ross selflessly agreed with the kids that doing the Race was an important, positive thing for them to do. I don’t know what state I’ll be in in July, I many be fully mobile, I may be in a wheelchair, I don’t know, so I said I’d make a call nearer the time.  Luckily,  members of The Gin Club had already signed up for the Race and Imy and Felix joined their team, and then they helped set up their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justgiving.com/ImyAndFelix/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Just Giving Page&lt;/a&gt;  If you feel inclined to sponsor them, please follow the link.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">It&#39;s my birthday next week. I&#39;ll be 39.&lt;p&gt;Back in November, when things were on an even keel, I had organised for myself and a small group of friends to go to a Gin Festival in London to celebrate my birthday as a treat for us all.  I don’t usually celebrate my birthdays in big ways.  They are usually sedate affairs involving Ross and the bairns and Tesco Club Card vouchers.  Organising an afternoon do in London felt quite an extravagance!  I hardly ever go into London these days, I spent years commuting from North Hertfordshire to the office on Regent Street, and if I’m honest, I don’t miss the Big Smoke too much.  I like living in our little country town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found out that I’d gotten a bit poorly again, I had assumed that my friends would just go to the festival without me.  My friends like gin!  We’re not called the Gin Club for nothing!  But then I was being told that plans needed to change, the afternoon was not going to happen without me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I’m not fit for much at the minute, in quite a lot of pain, and can’t walk very far, I decided that I’d like to have a few close friends round for a sophisticated afternoon tea, for a chat, and to help me deal with my new tea and cream scone obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then something strange happened.  I follow blog via Facebook called &lt;a href=&quot;http://hurrahforgin.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hurrah For Gin&lt;/a&gt;.  A Mum, called Katie,  who tells it how it is in her struggles with motherhood supported by gin.  She’s hilarious and strikes a chord with me.  Read her blog, buy Gin Bunny art.  She’s funny.  I think we’d get on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other night, I noticed Katie was running a competition to win a bottle of gin.  She was after a a funny story to give everyone a giggle. I decided to enter, thinking it would have been nice to give my friends who were missing out on the Gin Festival a cheeky tipple of gin during our afternoon tea.  My story wasn’t funny, it was quite maudlin, but it attracted a lot of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t win the competition for said bottle of gin. Katie was after a funny story, not my doom and gloom one, and the lady who won it, definitely deserved it a whole lot more than me.  I can’t mix my medication with alcohol, so at least she’ll be able to drink it and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it didn’t stop there.  It’s fair to say, things went a bit mental!  My original comment had been that my breast cancer had spread to my bones and was no longer curable and that I’d like to win the bottle of gin to thank my friends for being there for me during such a difficult time.  There were lots of nice comments and ‘likes’.  Facebook is good for things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My comment was still getting a lot of attention, and Katie had shared it on her page.  By Sunday morning, I had to enlist the help of my good friend Fiona to liaise with various different people and companies who wanted to donate things to my Afternoon Birthday Tea and Gin Treat.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been totally overwhelmed by the warmth and generosity of strangers.  Little me, turning 39 next week, with a husband, two kids, 3 cats, a penchant for gin, wit and sarcasm, but now with the support of the wider Gin Community helping me thank those that are closest to me for making this whole shitty journey a bit more manageable.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer, you really do suck.  But you will not suck the joy out of my life.  Not a chance.  Not when there are people like Katie from Hurrah for Gin, and Fiona, and the rest of my support group who will drop everything to help me out if I need anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Facebook alerts have gone mad, but it’s in a good way, and it’s taking my mind off the pain and the cancer, and it feels wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who has taken time to keep the light shining.  You have no idea how overwhelmed, humbled and grateful I am.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I have three brothers, Callum is a year and a half older than me, Regan is 5 years younger, and Max is 14 years younger.&lt;p&gt;I think it’s fair to say that over the past 15 years, my brothers and I have drifted apart, and we are not as close as we once were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed a happy, if slightly unusual childhood, we all got on and all turned into reasonably well adjusted human beings.  But things change, I moved to London, and we don’t see each other as often as we want.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/brothers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Brothers and Me&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo was taken when Regan married Lorna a few years ago.  It was a great day of laughing, celebrating and general silliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then something big happens.  Like getting told you have Cancer.  The first time round, in October 2013, everyone thought that it was just a lump (no pun intended) in the road.  A small hiccup.  Pick yourself up, dust yourself down, crack back on.   Nothing to worry about.  Modern medicine is great.  That’s what was supposed to happen. The statistics are on my side. We had all the time in the world to see each other.  During one of our visits, I was chatting to Callum asking what he was planning for his 40th birthday. I’d joked that I’d just like to be alive on my 40th.  I didn’t actually mean it, I thought I would be around for decades.  These things happen to “other people”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last week, unbeknownst to me, Ross had been in cahoots with Callum and Regan, and at 10am on Friday morning after driving for over 200 miles, they arrived on my doorstep.  They had come for the day to see me, because now it’s important.  Now we don’t have the luxury of time on our hands.  They were armed with meals, care packages, and stuff for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chatted about this and that for a little while and then got on to the Big Stuff.  Callum had a look at my MRI images, trying to see what the doctors had decided was suspicious, he may have been able to see something, but it gave him something solid to focus on.   It was so hard telling them that this disease, that was supposed to be a minor glitch, was going to get the better of me, and there was nothing I could do about it.  That was tough.  Very tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do after that?  Well you go to the pub next door, get sausage baguettes, get a hug off the land lord, and laugh about what we got up to as kids.  Remind ourselves that we had years of shared, happy, history, that needs to be passed on to our kids.  My kids might live ‘Down South’ but they still needs to have connections to their cousins ‘Up North’.  Callum and Regan need to make sure that this happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short while later, the school run is done and Imy and Felix are excited to see their Uncles and it’s not long before Top Trumps is being played, sweets are being eaten and the cheekiness starts.  At this point, I start to snooze, but as everything seems to be under control, there is no issue and Callum tells me to carry on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long, it’s time for them to say goodbye, so more hugs, and we wave them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to see them.  We talked more on that day than we had in years.  It was good, I enjoyed it.  I do love my brothers, I need them to know that.  I’ll be looking forward to squeezing Max when I see him next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully once we’ve got some of the pain under control, I’ll be able to go on a visit to see them.  Create some more shared, happy memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Today is World Cancer Day.&lt;p&gt;And what better way to spend it than at The Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust specialised cancer centre.  It takes ages to get there, and as I’m not sleeping well at night, I use the opportunity to catch up on some zzzzz’s.  I feel bad about this as Ross is also sleeping badly, but he’s the one who can drive so he gets the short straw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve registered for our appointment, and filled in the relevant paperwork we wait to see the consultant to discuss the next phase of treatment.  Except today we don’t see my consultant.  We see someone else.  This isn’t a problem at all, he’s an expert in Cyberknife.  He knows what he’s talking about and answers our questions thoroughly.  He talks more to Ross than me, as I appear to be on another planet, and I’m not really taking things in.  This is why having Ross with me at these appointments is so important.  Goodness knows what I’d bring out from the meetings…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyberknife technology is extremely accurate.  They are only interested in frying the bad cells.  We get shown where the treatment is going to be done, what the machine looks like, and it’s explained that during the sessions, a CT scanner will be constantly used, and the rays adjusted to ensure maximum damage to the cancer, minimal damage to me and my important nerves.  Each treatment will last about an hour, there will be one session a day and I will have 3 sessions.  My first session is in Tuesday, 9th February, and I will be finished on Thursday 11th.  I’m grateful that these sessions only take days, not weeks, like the radiotherapy for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  <content type="html">Tuesday morning starts at 3am.&lt;p&gt;Ross and I wake early and chat about what is to happen today.  I’m booked into the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, North London in order that they can give me a bone biopsy of the naughty vertebrae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was due to be there for 7am, so at 6am we were on our way down the A1.  That road at that time is horrible.  There are idiots around at that time.  It is very dark, and everyone seems to need to be very close to the car in front.  Talk about making a stressful situation more stressful than in needs to be!  I’m so glad I don’t have to do that journey often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross dropped me off at the main doors, and went off to find a parking space. This hospital is very quirky.  All corridors seem to be off a very sloped corridor.  It’s just odd.  Also, because of the nature of the hospital, everyone has mobility problems, which means everyone thinks they have priority over everyone else.  This makes for some hilarious stand offs.  Who goes first?  The patient in the bed, the one in the wheelchair, the one on crutches or the one with one leg.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later, we were on the ward which I had been instructed to go to only to be told that there was no record of me on their list for that day.  More letters were produced, I turned my humour up a notch (it was either that or cry), and the relevant information was found and I was taken to another ward where my name was on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had thought that the bone biopsy was to be done under local anaesthetic and that we would be out of the hospital quite quickly.  As it turns out, after a discussion with a very nice Anaesthetist, it is revealed that it was all to be done under a General. This means they have to go through my medical history and current medication list. This takes some time, but it gives me a chance to explain that I don’t tolerate GA’s very well and this gives her enough information to make sure that she gives me plenty anti-sickness drugs.  Once all this is done, the porter is ready to take me down to the imaging unit.  The biopsy that they are doing is being done using a CT scanner so they can have maximum accuracy when taking samples out with needles.  No one really wants to guess when you are dealing with the spine and nerves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross accompanies me down to the imaging unit, helps me change into a gown, and after a chat with the doctor who is doing the procedure, it’s not long before he’s despatched back to our ward and I’m in lying down having cannula’s inserted and the drugs are administered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What feels like five seconds later, I’m awake and before long I’m back on the ward with Ross.  I’m anxious to get my painkillers back on the go, and thanks to a wonderful nurse, we are given the permissions we need and I’m feeling more at ease with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey home happens in a whirl.  Helen, one of the wonderful ladies I met online through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Breast Cancer Care &lt;/a&gt; November Newbie 2013 support forums, organised for a charity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/blanketssentwithlove/&quot;&gt;Sent With Love&lt;/a&gt; to send me a beautiful handmade blanket.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sent-with-love.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Comfort Blanket&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blanket is the perfect size for me to take with me to hospital, to remind me of home.  The children had been given instructions to have the blanket around them whenever they can so they can get their smell on it.  (The nice after bath, clean smells, not the slightly cabbagy school smell).  This blanket is rolled up and used as a pillow and before long, Ross has got me home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so tired, Dad gives me my tea early, and off I go to bed.  The drugs alarms are all set, so I don’t have to worry about forgetting anything and that’s that.  Night night.  Off to sleep and a new day tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Monday was a Greek Day!&lt;p&gt;Imy’s school year were taking part in an Ancient Greek Day, so she had to go in dressed in appropriate clothing.  We spent an hour on Sunday evening curling her hair with the stylers she received for Christmas and then she slept with her hair in a turban in order to keep it looking in tip top condition.  On Monday morning, the rest of the costume was assembled which included a fleece blanket (it’s February, it’s cold, I don’t want her to wear a white sheet),  tied in place with safety pins, broaches, cords and scarves.  She’s delighted and skips off to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/greek-imy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ancient Greek Imy&quot; style=&quot;width: auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day is relatively quiet, and quiet days are good.  Michelle came round to drink tea from china cups, which was lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were supposed to be getting a visit from the community Macmillan nurses, but due to illness and cover issues, it’s had to be rearranged.  We’ll meet them eventually and we’ll be able to see what services we can tap into, and utilize.  I’m keen to get some sort of support in place for Imy and Felix as they have a lot of things that they need to process and I am aware that I’m not the best person to be able to help them to do it.  There are experts out there,  (which in itself is something that is hard to comprehend), and if that helps my bairns try and process the situation that we are in, then all the better.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">I have my own ways of doing things.  &lt;p&gt;Whether that be the order the laundry goes on, where the beans are kept in the cupboard, what to buy for the Bairn’s friends birthday presents etc, or which is the best toothpaste, meal planning.  I decide.  It’s all worked well.  Everyone knows what to expect as “if Mamma’s happy, everybody’s happy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I’m having to give up on that control bit by bit.  Yesterday on the way back from Felix’s swimming lesson, Ross, my Dad and Felix were told to get a birthday present for Imy’s friend, Iris, and I had asked Ross to get me some sort of receptacle to store the things that I needed on my bedside table.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not sure exactly what went on, but the outcome was a success.  Asking Felix to choose something a girl a year older than him caused him some confusion, my Dad just left the shop unwilling to take any responsibility for the decisions being made, but Ross rose to the challenge and surpassed himself.  He’s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I’d organised my bedside table with said new receptacle, I spoke to Max and he suggested I try one of the fancy candles he’d sent me in his Care Package.  Unfortunately the stupid cat decided at that moment she needed to be on the windowsill exactly where the candle was.  Candle tipped up, freaked out cat, wax everywhere.  Me in tears, Imy in tears, but no real harm done.  Imy went off to get a more substantial candle jar to put it in and with the help from some huggles and some Oramorph, things settled down again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Care Packages have been great fully received.  They are all very different, thoughtful, and put together with love, kindness and generosity.  Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also thank you for the hugs and messages of support.  I appreciate getting messages or texts (so don’t start the message off by saying, “I hope you don’t mind…”),  as I can read and respond to them as and when I am ready.  I’m a bit funny when it comes to actually talking on the phone though.  So, if you do ring and I don’t answer, leave a message.  I’m probably hiding behind a cushion what the drama is call about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Anyone who knows me, knows I drink coffee.&lt;p&gt;I drink proper, dripped, strong coffee - I don’t drink tea.  Coffee that is strong enough to stand your spoon up in it.   Don’t talk to me until I’ve had at least one cup in the morning.  It’s not worth it.  Come 1pm, I’m coffee’d out and will switch to squash.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except something strange has happened.  I will have a cup of coffee with breakfast, but after that, I will have a cup of fruit tea.  From a bone china cup and saucer. (Specifically an MG cup and saucer I won in a school raffle about 6 years ago.)  Or, if it’s bedtime, a cup of camomile tea in by bone china  Kate and William Royal Wedding mug (I love twee).  It’s all a bit bizarre!  I don’t know what has changed, but I can’t drink coffee the way I used to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep my mind off the recent craziness, on Thursday, Pinky came round to show me how to crochet.  We drank fruit tea from china cups, chatted about nothing and everything, and managed to make a start with a hook and wool.  She’ll have to come back so we can do it again.  I’m determined to be able to crochet a Granny Square, and maybe even a Remembrance Day Poppy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst all this tea is being drunk, arrangements are being made for me to have samples taken from my spine next week.  This is to check that the treatment plan they have lined up to use is the best one for me.  I had received a letter that tells me I have to be nil by mouth from midnight the night before the procedure.  This worries me, if my pain levels aren’t under control, I won’t be able to get to the hospital in the first place, never mind have samples taken.  Fortunately, I speak to a very knowledgeable and understanding pre-op nurse who guides me through what I can and can’t take on the morning of the procedure and I feel calmer.  We can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning, Tash popped in for a quick cup of fruit tea in a china cup, and after a quick nap, I decided that I felt well enough to go and watch Felix’s Jungle Class Assembly with Ross and my Dad.  The school have been brilliant and said we can park within the grounds when we need to, which makes things so much easier.  It was still a long walk to the school hall, and I had sweat dripping off me throughout the assembly, but the kids were great.  Lots of singing, information and funky dancing.   My walking stick seemed to cause a bit of cause stir with the kids.  “Why’s your Mum got a stick, Felix?”.  He turns, shrugs, “Cancer’s spread”.  Heartbreaking.  He shouldn’t have to say words like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to as few School Mum’s who I hadn’t seen in a while.  It’s good to catch up on other people’s news, remind myself that there are other things going on.  Good things are going on.  Happy things are going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The busy day that I had, took it’s toll on me, and I was in bed by 5:30pm.  Luckily I have alarms set to wake me up to take my medication.  I’d be in all sorts trouble if I missed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Here I am, awake and waiting for the painkillers to kick in.  It&#39;s all getting very tiresome.&lt;p&gt;Sunday and Monday ended up as quiet days, and they were good days.  I like quiet, calm days.  Imy needed some persuasion to get to school, but she’d had a good chat with a key worker and seemed happier on her return home.  We are finding her more emotional than normal, but all we can do is make sure she knows she is loved and supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday arrived, and we were up and at ‘em early to get the kids dropped off at school and then us off to the hospital to get my port reinserted.  I had been hoped they’d knock me out for it, but due to the cocktail of drugs I’m already taking, they just gave me a little bit of sedation, local anesthetic, and 30 minutes later, I was back in my room watching the end of Bargain Hunt with Ross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I’d been in theatre, Ross had spoken to my GP to get my pain meds tweaked.  The levels just weren’t quite right and I was finding it difficult to keep under control.  Between them, they came up with a plan, and I’ll be able to function with some level of normality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit later on I got a message that my Dad had arrived at ours, so the kids would be collected from school with no fuss or drama.  Tea was made for them, and they were taken to after school activities once their homework had been completed.  I think my Dad was a bit shocked in the difference between me since the last saw me at Christmas. A month ago, I was just normal little me.  Getting on with life.  Now I’m discussing adapting my way of living to make things easier for me and those around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I need to look into quickly though is getting a Blue Badge.  I can’t walk far, I’m using a stick and trying to do normal stuff is becoming more problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m getting my first dose of Herceptin today, as well as a bone strengthener.  A long dull day in hospital but a positive step to giving this horrible disease its marching orders again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Just a little note to say thank you to everyone who has sent a care package.  Large or small, edible or not, even the messages, emails, texts and calls.  They are all appreciated and make me feel like I’ve got an army of supporters helping me walk along the road I need to travel.  It’s not too much fun at the minute, but it won’t all be doom and gloom either.  I can’t live like that.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">Things are starting to get harder for me.&lt;p&gt;I’m finding it harder to walk any great distance.  School runs are out.  I can’t drive due to the meds and keeping comfortable for any length of time is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday night, I’d woken up as usual at 5am in discomfort.  By the time I’d been to the loo, things had reached a peak and I was crying and screaming in pain.  It took 10 minutes to get the level 10 pain down to a still very Hurty 8 pain.  Unfortunately I’d woken Imy up and she got rather distressed with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross took the kids to rugby to allow them some normality, and Charli came round to keep me company and make sure the pain remained under control.  It was very much appreciated and kept me occupied enough to get through the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ross came back, he went to Tesco for some supplies.  These included a shower chair, a coccyx cushion, a wall handle for the bathroom and a walking stick.  This has really upset me as walking sticks are for old people. I’m only 38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get some much needed relief by lying on the floor in the front room. Obviously it’s a bit of a pain for the rest of the family, but they’ll have to get used to it.  Imy has asked if it’s likely that I’ll wake up crying in the night again.  I hope not.  It’s not pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">The phone has been ringing a lot at our house recently.&lt;p&gt;It’ll be the doctor, the chemo ward, the insurance company. All giving me information, updates and appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To distract myself, on Wednesday, Tash drove me to choir so I could sing. I’m so glad she did. When I got my primary diagnosis I promised myself I’d start to do things I had been putting off. The first one of those things was to join a choir. Luckily, one had started up a month or so before locally in Baldock, so I put my big girl pants on, and went along. I’ve loved it all. I’ve met some truly lovely people and learned to have confidence in my singing again. (I lost all confidence in my ability in my late teens and it was just something I would do in the shower. ) I’ve since sung at Christmas concerts, collaborative concerts, an open mike session and even in a group at someone’s wedding. A few people at choir already knew what was occuring thanks to the power of social media, so I got some lovely hugs and much appreciated words of encouragement. As long as I can sing, I’ll be there, with the Naughty Alto’s, having fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-organised&quot;&gt;Getting Organised&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started to gather together paperwork so that all my financial stuff is in one place. Pensions, bank accounts, and I also set up a funeral insurance plan. Not the happiest of jobs, but I don’t want Ross to have to worry about how he’ll cope with it all. One phone call, one direct debit set up, and it was all done. We must get round to sorting our Will out too. It won’t be complicated, Ross get’s everything, and there’s not even that much of that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-looking-cancer-patient-in-hertfordshire&quot;&gt;Best Looking Cancer Patient in Hertfordshire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to not allow standards to slip, I went to see my lovely hairdresser Isabel yesterday to get my hair cut and coloured. As it’s not been decided if I’ll be having a chemo treatment which will cause my hair to fall out or not yet, I thought I might as well start the process off looking a million dollars. If it falls out later, so be it, but for now, I’m delighted. It’s great to be able to have such trust in a hairdresser to be able to say, I want it cut and coloured - you decide what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;another-scan&quot;&gt;Another Scan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I can start treatment, I had to get a last minute appointment see a cardiologist to check my heart was well enough to withstand it. Herceptin has been shown to damage some people’s hearts to the extent where treatment has to be stopped. Luckily, my heart is in tip top condition so there’s no issue with moving onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;treatment-begins&quot;&gt;Treatment Begins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week the fun really begins. I’m having a port reinserted on Tuesday to allow for easy administration of infusions. Herceptin, the targeted treatment will start on Wednesday and I’ll also get an infusion of Zometa which will help plug the holes in my damaged vertebrae. These treatments will be every 3 weeks for as long as they continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dad will be coming down to look after the kids for a bit whilst this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the meantime, the flowers, gifts, chocolates and messages of support continue to come in and lift our spirits. We’re in a really tough place, but knowing we have a legion behind us, is keeping us going. Ross had to take Felix to his swimming lesson this morning, but my pain has gone up a notch, and I’m finding it hard to get comfortable. Ross wasn’t going to take Felix, but rather stay with me. He changed his mind when I told him that if anything changed, I would put a shout out and that I was confident someone would be able to come round and keep me company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-cancers-are-different&quot;&gt;All cancers are different&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word Cancer is an umbrella term for a wide range of diseases.  For every cell in the human body, their can be one or more associated, renegade cancer cells. There is not a “One Size Fits All” cancer diagnosis. There are also different stages and grades. Grade 1 is slow growing, Grade 3 is fast growing. Stage 1 is contained in a small place, Stage 4 for travelled. You can’t compare different cancers, it’s like comparing apples to pears.  Both fruit, both different. You can’t compare Stage 4, Grade 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma with Stage 3 Liver cancer. They all have different treatments, and prognosis. Everyone will also have different treatment plans too, even if they do happen to have the same diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-cure&quot;&gt;No Cure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tough things to try and explain is that now that the cancer has come back, there is no cure. Yes, we got on top of it once, and I “beat it”, but that can’t be done this time. No amount of positive thinking, tumeric, cannabis oil or fairy dust is going to get rid of this blasted disease. It’s decided I’m a nice place to stay. (I’m not flattered about this.) The best we can hope for is that the treatment keeps it under control for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still not a fan of the battle/warrior/fighter/brave analogies. This isn’t a fight that I’ll win. It doesn’t mean I didn’t try hard enough, it means that Cancer is a horrific, destructive and merciless disease that takes no prisoners. I hate it, because it’s robbing my family of our future together. My babies deserve so much better. My husband had hoped to be married to me for a long time yet. My parents shouldn’t have to be having the conversations they are having. My brother’s shouldn’t have to face up to the loss of a sibling (even if I am the annoying, shouty, loud one). My friends may have to have some very scary conversations with their children that sometimes there is nothing you can do about an altogether horrible situation, and all you can do is offer a friendly ear, hug or word of compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-babies&quot;&gt;My Babies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side point, can I ask that my friends who know Imogen and Felix and want their children to be there for them, that they allow Imy and Felix to talk abut things on their own terms?  They don’t need to be bombarded with questions or statistics or be told how long I’m going to live for.  Can I ask that you talk to them and ask them to be compassionate and kind.  The future is very uncertain for Imy and Felix and they don’t need to have any extra or unnecessary hurt caused by someone’s lack of empathy or thinking.  When I was their age it wouldn’t even been on my radar that I could lose a parent, and it breaks my heart for them, to think that this is in their future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enough&quot;&gt;Enough!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough wallowing! Because at this very moment we’ve got time. For now I’ll take the hugs, and the love and support. I’ll keep on smiling, I’ll probably keep on swearing and making very inappropriate jokes. I’ll be offering hugs to people who find it frightening and scary. I’ll be the one saying “ Everything will be OK”. Because that’s me. That’s who I am. And that’s not going to change just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep on, keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jx&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">There&#39;s no right or wrong way to deal with life changing news, there&#39;s no rule book.&lt;p&gt;There may be some self help books, but &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; reads them just in case?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mixed-bag&quot;&gt;Mixed Bag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now the news is public, I’m not going to rehash it but in short it’s a mixed bag. Good news is it’s only in one place, so much more containable. Bad news we’re not talking cure but containment. We’re hoping for a record breaking amount of time containing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My emotions have been up and down, the metaphor I used in my head was swimming in stormy seas. Waves of grief for a future that won’t happen, sadness and worry for Julia, being scared of being alone all crashing into me. It was a rawness I’ve never felt before and I’ve glimpsed a chasm of despair that is so alien to me and my personality. It’s a worrying time to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;telling-the-world&quot;&gt;Telling the world&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had told the kids the basics in the morning, Imogen was brave and worried, Felix seemed unsure. It felt good to let them know it’s not their fault Mum and Dad have been fraught over the weekend. We have to keep them talking and let them express any worries over the coming months / years. I plan to be proactive about it but I can see it’s going to be a fine line between asking and over asking. I’ll have to stay attuned and am planning at some point making sure that they (we?) get counselling to ensure that they become the well adjusted and wonderful children that Julia and I know they will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to the teachers at school - through sobs and asked them to look after the kids today. It was just so hard to speak about it and acknowledge it publicly. I was a mess and the teachers were kind but probably more than a little bemused and concerned. Whilst leaving the playground, I happened to bump into Rachel and then Adam and needed hugs from them both so I could compose myself - thanks you two it was much needed and much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia and I headed off to the Doctors for better meds, tears filled my eyes more than once and I realised I best to speak to one soon as well. We got more meds, a bagful, the lady at the pharmacy was kind and efficient and we headed back home. The extra meds have helped Julia get more comfortable and reach a lower number of the pain scale. It breaks my heart that even with all these meds she is still on the pain scale but I can but hope future treatment will sort that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We publish our blog posts and let the world know, Facebook is a marvelous thing at times. Julia announced the news and support, love and kind words flood in raising our spirits. I had a meltdown in the kitchen and posted my own post to facebook. The amount of support was humbling and helped my sea of anxiety soften. I took strength from the comments, encouragement and love that came through. Support has flooded in from best friends, old friends, internet wierdy friends (Julia’s terminology!) and even people we have never met or spoken to. It’s been amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hard-times-ahead&quot;&gt;Hard times ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of Felix’s, told him that if Julia’s cancer has comeback then she’ll be dead in five years. It’s shocking and I don’t know where a 7 year old would get that from but I can’t be angry at Felix’s friend, he’s a child just like Felix. Anyway, Felix told me he doesn’t believe it and we talked about it with Imogen on the way home from school. I couldn’t lie and tell them it definitely won’t be the case but rather, I stuck to the positives, no one knows the future and the doctors are working their hardest to do their best to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Julia and I don’t know the implications of the reoccurrence of cancer, then how can the kids? We have to keep to the positives and ask the kids to be the best they can be and make sure they talk if they need to and get space when they need as well. Felix, holds his feelings closer than Imy and that night for the first time in an age he has a bed wetting accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fog-clearing&quot;&gt;Fog clearing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to see the Doctor myself yesterday, I had been feeling better or rather more on an even keel. I bumped into Pinky and that facade crumbled but it all helps - thanks for the hugs. I spoke to doctor, talked myself out of any medication but I know that they are there should they be needed. That in itself has been a big relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rawness of the initial shock seems to be leaving and I feel more positive. The insurance company are on board, which is a relief and we are starting treatment next week. I even managed to tell my colleagues at work without booing - a big improvement. The house seems to be running smoothly, chief laundry master Lawley has stepped up to the plate! Being proactive always helps me and I’m glad to say my wobbles have been further apart. I’m sure they’ll be back but with such awesome support from friends and family I know we’ll stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross&lt;/p&gt;
