  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thanksgiving Thursday Julia and I do an epic christmas shop, we will be well fed and watered in the Lawley house this year! On Friday, Imogen has her school play, it’s fantastic, she rocks. On Friday evening Greg has arranged a head wetting to celebrate the arrival of Joni Martin. I’m glad to say my thirst returned and the Gin Club dads were all on good form. During the night I was getting text updates from Julia making sure she was ok. After a couple of beers and a tour of Baldock’s lesser pubs I head on home.  Julia is still up when I get home and has been through a whole packet of Halls for a sore throat. I find this out a few days later but it explains Julia’s texts and highlights that where sickness is involved, we are are on an amber alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I awake with a headache (must have had a dodgy pint) and after paracetomal and water fail me, I decide to go for a run. Felix heads downstairs for a session of Lego Star Wars on the playstation (a highly addictive (as in crack) game for 5 year olds). Imogen on the other hand decides to tag along and we head off for a run.  She’s great company and even wins 2 of the 3 mini sprint races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before I head off to take Felix to little ruggers Michelle drops off some frozen dinners which is a massive help - thank you! I head off to little ruggers only to find its not on as it’s the schools Christmas fair. So I head to the supermarket and Felix is placeted by a getting a chocolate Freddo. Anna comes round to take Imogen to her dance class - thanks again Anna. As I’m now a fully fledged Laundry Master I crack on with the weeks laundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That afternoon we head off to Petes 40th Birthday do, I drive as Julia isn’t up for walking. We have a great time - Pete and Lesely’s curries are awesome and the chilli lime pickle was burnylicious.  We had a great time and headed home when I saw that Julia looking tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday came round and I marshalled the bairns for their swimming lessons, whilst Julia had a lie in.  Imogen managed to get some new goggles out of me, seems she’s been growing. Felix has his lesson first, whilst Imogen and I splash round and practise diving in. Imogen has a talent of starting to dive, then falling horizontally into the water, it’s impressive. Not nearly as impressive as my splash when I dive in apparently. Soon its Imogen’s lesson and Felix and I splash around. He’d been complaining that the Green caps are too hard, well that seems to have been forgotten and he swims wonderfully and even shows me his dolphin legs and butterfly stroke. I get told I’m doing mine wrong by lifting my head out the water. He’s a chip off the old block, one lesson on butterfly and he’s a master!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That afternoon Regan, Lorna, Elsie and Oscar arrive and we head to the Orange Tree for lunch. Its great to see them and the afternoon flies. I even found time to make mince pies (it was that or fall asleep). They don’t look like any mince pies you can buy but tasted about right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday night comes all too quickly, as Julia is feeling ok I sign up for a conference in London for Monday and Tuesday.  The conference is great and Michelle’s frozen meals save the day. On Monday night Christmas arrives to the Lawley house, all decorations are up. We are signalling our intent that Santa should stop at the Lawley house this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its Tuesday now and I’m back in the conference, Julia headed to work this morning. I feel low when I get a text from her telling me her hair has started to fall out. I call her and she’s ok - it was inevitable and it’s not falling out in clumps. She rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My overriding thoughts from the last few days have been our friends are great abd we are lucky to have them.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ross went into London for a geek meet, so I was home alone.  At lunchtime, I pulled the boxes of Christmas decorations out, and put up a few festive ornaments.  When Ross got home, I supervised him putting up some more lights, the tree and when the bairns came home they helped me decorate it.  The problem we have us that we don’t have enough decorations for the new house!  The front room looks great, but there is nothing in the kitchen/dining room.  This obviously needs to be rectified.  Especially as we’re having Christmas at home this year.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been 5 and a half weeks since I started to take Tamoxifen which blocks the hormone receptors in the tumours to stop them growing, and a week and a half since I started my chemo and Herceptin to kill and shrink the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there’s been some side effects.  Not the the chest pains that took us to A&amp;amp;E, and the fatigue which I was expecting, but headaches, nausea, sore mouth and the most annoying, night sweats.  I don’t have a temperature, but I wake in the night drenched.  A few minutes later, I cool down, fall back to sleep, pull the covers back up, and shortly after, I’m over heating again, in a cruel vicious circle.  Of course this is affecting my sleep, and I’m having crazy dreams.  Last night’s involved making a Mary Berry, Great British Bake Off Christmas Yule Log which I saw her make on the tv yesterday.  Felix expressed an interest in it, and I told him we’d try and make it.  So my dream involved buying the ingredients, and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another side effect is I’m off alcohol.  We went to a friends birthday party yesterday, and all I could manage was two glasses of sparkley.  This is almost unheard of.  Still, it’ll mean the Christmas wine will go further…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At midday, my brother Regan, his wife Lorna, and Elsie and Oscar arrived.  It was great to see them, and they were a delight.  Again, I am reminded how wonderful my family is.  We went to the Orange Tree for a magnificent pub lunch (best in a Baldock in my opinion), and I managed a couple of halves of Buntingford Silent Night ale.  Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got back, Regan helped Ross get some lights up in the tree in the front garden.  It’s very festive.  Not sure what the neighbours think though, we seem to be the first in the street to put any lights up indoor or outdoor!  Oh well, start as we mean to go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sad when it was time for them to leave, but I’m so glad they came.  I’m very tired now, do it’ll be bath and bed for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s odd, because even after just a week after the treatment I think I can feel a change in Big Lump.  This is obviously great news.  What I didn’t expect was sickness to hit me like a train in the middle of the night.  It was too late to take the anti sickness tablets so the inevitable happened.  This then meant that I was tired today so I’ve spent it in bed.  The bairns dispensed their usual healing hugs before Ross took them to breakfast club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weird side effect is the inside of my mouth feels funny.  Like I’ve eaten too many sherbet lemons and that makes my lips feels cracked and dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a visit from Ally yesterday which was lovely.  He’s been in the States so hasn’t seen us since the news broke.  More hugs, more offers of help.  It’s good to know we have such good friends around.  Friends who will cut us a bit of slack, allow us to use them as a sounding board, and just understand that we need TLC and not pull us up on our shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re starting to think more about Christmas.  Ross has ordered the turkey crown from the butchers and lists are being made.  We’re thinking about putting the Christmas decorations up at the weekend and then put the tree up the week afterwards.  I’m not feeling massively festive, but now that I’ve got a follow from the Official Santa on Twitter, I’m hoping to tap into some of the big man’s magic.   My Dad and Julie are going to be here for Christmas, as is Uncle Max, so I’m sure it’ll be great.  It’s the Gin Club Christmas do the weekend after next, and I’m hoping to feel well enough for that.  They’ll have to forgive me if I recycle a previous Christmas dress, I can’t be bothered to go clothes shopping.  Although I have noticed Tesco have got a wonderful range of Christmas jumpers in…  I wonder…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening was a bit of a logistical feat to get the bairns from Clair’s, to Catherine and Toms with keys so they could be taken back to ours later whilst we went to the hospital to see the Oncologist.  It turns out the things that have been going on have been a reaction to the chemo.  The doctor agreed that the tumour has shrunk substantially already which is very reassuring to know, but it’s that which caused the chest pains. The doctor is going to change the drug and cycle so instead of another 3 cycles every 3 weeks, I’ll be starting weekly cycles for 9 weeks.    This’ll kick off in 2-3 weeks.  I’ve got more steroids to take and more instructions to keep taking the anti sickness drugs.  I’m annoyed that I wasn’t able to take the side effects from the first lot of chemo but equally, I don’t fancy feeling like this for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got back home and the kids were in bed having their story read by Catherine.  They bounced down the stairs when we got in and gave me some fantastic hugs.  We ushered them back to bed, all listened to the story and then it was more hugs and bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is another day.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia had two appointments today and we had to hang round for both. In the morning they took bloods to see how she’s doing now after the weekends visit to A&amp;amp;E. In the afternoon they reviewed the bloods and saw that they were still good.  The doctor advised that it was most likely a side effect of chemotherapy and that we should do regular check ins with the GP every to make sure we get a holistic view of Julia’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night I woke when Julia rushed out the room and was sick. It reminded me of Julia’s morning sickness but the situation is much less happy. I went and fetched the nausea tablets. Unfortunately, no sooner than they went down, Julia got to see them again :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia wasn’t sick again but certainly looked green gilled in the morning. After a call to the nurse I was able to give Julia more tablets to help settle things.  She was wiped out though and didn’t manage to get out of bed until it was nearly time to go to see the clinical oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oncologist is super nice, he is happy that the chemotherapy is working but he’s not happy about its impact on Julia.  He notes there has been an extreme tumor reaction and its shrunk. This may also have counted for some of the chest pains Julia is suffering from. He plans to move Julia onto a sister drug, which will mean weekly chemotherapy with hopefully a level impact. In the meantime whilst this round of chemotherapy is still in her system Julia is given steroids to help counter the fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get home and the kids are already for bed, thanks Tom and Catherine for looking after them.  Imogen is still buzzing from her assembly which she had
practised during the day - Julia and I are looking forward to seeing it on Friday.  I read some more of the brilliant Famous Five to everyone and then its hugs and bed.  I forgot to cook early on, so I make Julia some soup and I get a take away curry.  Julia’s taste buds have been changed, she struggles with the soup but the allure of curry wins and she tucks into some more food :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ross and I are very much stuck in the moment at the minute.  We are keeping our heads down and dealing with the immediate things that need to be dealt with.  With everything that is going on we can only ask for patience and understanding.  We may not get everything right all the time, but hey, being diagnosed with cancer pretty much means all bets are off and normal rules don’t apply.  We are trying our best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the weekends adventures we had to have a bit of a debrief from those overseeing my care.  So, I’ve spoken to two nurses, two doctors and a ward sister so far today.  Just a regular day in the Lawley house.  I’m still having chest pains,  but I’m still taking the painkillers and the Oncologist has asked me to get a prescription from my GP to try something else too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross and I are both working at home today.  My Immune system is probably at it’s weakest, so it’s best to stay away from the great unwashed at the minute.  I’m glad that I have the option to work at home as it means I feel like I’m being useful and I’m not rotting my brain by watching daytime tv.  (My colleagues may not actually agree with that though…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bairns were lovely this morning.  Both came in and gave me a lovely hug before they went off to breakfast club.  I love my kids, I am so proud of them and they amaze me every single day with their resilience and ability to plough on.  I am truly lucky to be their mum.  Yes, they get shouted out every so often, but who cares.  They don’t.  They know they are loved and are confident and secure in themselves and our little family unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pinky dropped off a very kind and thoughtful set of gifts.  I’m looking forward to opening them all later with the kids.  Thank you Pinky. x&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My mum comes with me as she wants to watch the kids, we get to the pool but the lessons are cancelled as there had been a power outage overnight resulting in the pool temperature being too low.  We head to Letchworth leisure centre instead and I take the kids for a swim whilst granny watches from the cafe and has a coffee.  The kids are good little fishes and enjoy a splashing around and swimming in the deep end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We head home via the supermarket and I stock up on food for the week. I’m off beer whilst Julia is poorly and although it’s missed, it’s absence will do me some good. After lunch my parents help return Imogens room back to normal and then head home to Newbury. It’s been good having them here and we do appreciate their help this week. It hasn’t all been smooth, feathers have been ruffled on both sides but it is a time of stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dinner I cook up a roast, I see it all as practice for christmas. A roast chicken with new potatoes, yorkshire pudding and 4 different vegetables. Team Lawley wolf it down and then start getting ready for the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening I catch up on the blog and put my foot in it big time with my Mum, it seems I’ve lost my
tact button and am unwittingly thoughtless. After a terse email telling me I upset her and detailing some of our shortcomings this week, I quickly remove the offending text from the post and email an apology back. I am sorry for upsetting her, I didn’t mean to and now Julia is also upset (nice one Ross). I can’t sleep because of it but after a few hours stewing on it I have to put in proper perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have the mental bandwidth to deal with this all now as well as Julia’s cancer and I have to prioritise her first. This is a traumatic time in our lives and at times I will be bad company, self absorbed, thoughtless, tactless, feckless and other adjectives ending in less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only apologise and ask for forgiveness in advance. I will try to be a better person but when I fail do call me up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry mum x&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I awake at 3:30 for some reason, Grandad is in the loo and I need to spend
a penny.  I head downstairs and just as I’m turning off a light I hear a pop
upstairs and the lamp downstairs switches off.  Then Julia is shouting and I
rush upstairs it seems the iPad charger has exploded and tripped all the sockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plug is covered in soot and the charger is in two parts - wowzers on later
inspection the charger is a counterfeit apple charger :( The good news is that Julia’s temp is good
but she mentions some chest tightness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning I’m happy that Julia’s temperature is back to normal and she heads
off to have her wig cut. Grandad and I take Felix to little ruggers and read the
paper whilst Felix charges about with a huge grin - he loves little ruggers.
When I get home Julia tells me the car lights on for a flat - so I head to Tescos
to fill it up and find one very low tire, a slow puncture just what I need and I
plan on getting it sorted asap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get home and Julia is more concerned about her chest. We try and phone the
nurse and the on-call mobile seems to have gone off line.  A couple of calls to
the hopsital and we get through and Julia is ordered to A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen is devistated that we can’t take her to dancing but I’m focused on the one
with chest pains so when asked, I decline to draw a map to dance studio - I’ve got
places to be, sorry Grandparents you’re in charge of the 7 year old howler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get to A&amp;amp;E, Julia signs in and I head off to get the car in the proper car
park. When I come back, there’s no Julia so I get directed to her.  They’ve done her
blood pressure and temp and decided she should be put in a side room on her own and not
with the rest of the sick plebs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia has an ECG, they take blood and order an x-ray.  They don’t tell us the
results of the ECG and that concerns me.  We sit and wait for someone to tell
us what’s going on.  It’s a well known fact that Hospital time breaks all known
rules of the universe. Each second drags, a minute lasts a eon but hours happily
roll by. I think it’s an elaborate illusion by your brain to protect you from the mind
numbing teadiousness of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen a consultant and lots of things have been ruled out, so they need to do
more blood tests.  The A&amp;amp;E sister has had enough of us hogging the side room
and we are moved back with the great unwashed to a new waiting room in the CDU.  There’s
some family there with a lad my age who has a swollen face, seems it’s a big day
out for them all.  The quick blood tests take hours and eventually Julia tactfully complains
that we’ve been there 7 hours and she has &lt;strong&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;, someone takes the hint
and a Nurse offers her food five minutes later - No luck for me they’ve just
run out.  I snag some ginger snaps from Julia’s handbag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultant comes back, hes a good bloke but is happy lots of bad things have
been ruled out but also concerned nothing has been ruled in.  Possibly a side
effect or the start of an infection. He wants her to stay overnight for
observations, Julia pleads her case to be sent home and we are given strict
instructions - &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; new symptons or &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; worsening then come back in.  He
also refers us for an ambulatory review for Monday / Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We head home, Julia is too shaky to walk to the carpark, so I run round to fetch
the car.  I’m starving so dive into the chippy for some lunch / tea.  I get home
and Julia takes her meds and goes to bed. My mum and dad have been great and had
the kids all day no problems, they tell us they are a credit to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no rule book or even guide book on how to cope with a loved one having
cancer. It impacts us all - family and friends, all in very different ways. We
have to remember that and accept that no one’s perfect and keep working and helping
each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great we are now getting Julia better but, my, it’s still an emotional
rollercoaster. The tears that were so effective at being a pressure valve when
the initial shock of the diagnosis have long gone. I need to find a replacement,
I tried meditating, exercise and even a good session in the pub. All help but none
so quick a fix as a good cry, lets hope writing this all down also works well.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was fairly chilled.  I went to Michelle’s for a coffee and a chat and then came home and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a list of symptoms to keep an eye out for which could indicate a reaction to treatments.  It’s quite a long list and we keep having to look at it to make sure nothing is happening that shouldn’t.  Into the evening, Ross noticed I was looking a bit flushed, so took my temperature.  Anything over 37.5’ he has to call the nurse.  It was over, so he called her.  I hate making a fuss, but was told to get over it and take a couple of paracetamol and call again if anything changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably about this time, I was starting to get chest pains.  I knew this was a big red flag and should mention it to Ross but I didn’t.  Ross woke up at 3am in the morning and went to get a glass of water.  Whilst he was gone the iPad charger which was plugged in behind my bedside table exploded.  Literally.  It went pop!  It tripped the sockets, but luckily apart from the charger and cable, and a slightly singed socket, all was fine.  I thought it prudent to mention the pains this point.  I played it down, and we went back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I went to see Izzy my hairdresser so she could work some magic on the wig I’d bought.  She did a great job.  It doesn’t scream wig, and I think it’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chest pains were still there, so when Ross came home from taking Felix to Ruggers, I thought it best to ‘fess up.  He was straight onto the nurse and we were told in no uncertain terms to get to A&amp;amp;E.  This unfortunately meant Imogen missing her dance class.  I’ll have to make it up to her.  She was very upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then we entered the time vortex of the Lister hospital.  I had all sorted of tests thrown at me and they all came back clear.  They kept me in to see if anything changed but it didn’t.  Eventually, I put up a convincing enough argument to be allowed home.  I have strict instructions to take the painkillers, and to go back if anything changes.  Anything at all.  I need to go back early next week for a review just to make sure though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m now in my own bed, still in pain, but home.  Maybe tomorrow will be better.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My lump in my mouth gotthe all clear on Tuesday night, it’s a benign bone growth
and can be removed if it causes any issue in the future. Julia and I come out
relieved and now I can focus on her properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was a scary day the first chemotherapy session - a daunting prospect.
Julia slept terribly the night before and so did I. She woke me by crashing round
like the rolling waves of a storm. I’d had enough and suggested that we watch
something instead of huffing and puffing about not being asleep. So, it’s 4am and we
are watching Hebbern, it’s funny, we laugh and then I fall asleep. Julia is not
so lucky and wrestles with things for a while longer before sleep claims her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning we head off for the chemotherapy and it surprises us. It all
seems so ordinary, they plug Julia into the machine via her port (it reminds me
of the matrix) and after a couple hours of flushing the port, chemotherapy drugs
and flushing again we head home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s back to hospital for a round of a complimentary drug called Herceptin.
It’s a biological therapy that specifically targets the HER2 positive cancer
that Julia has. As Julia kept the needle in her port overnight the treatment
quickly starts. Once administered we have to hang round for 5 hours to make
sure there are no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia passes the time watching day time tv and on the Gin Club photo challenge - sorting
out the Gin Club photo albumn into date order.  Julia writes an email to my work
thanking them for being ace - I’m truly lucky to work for such a great and
understanding company. I spend the time baking next to the radiator and escaping
into my computer by watching another round of lectures and coding for the
course I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before we leave Julia gets a course in injecting herself with a booster
and then graduates by doing it. She’s a gutsy lady my Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get home tired, the kids all play up and get a shouting at. Unfortunately, my mum
copped a shouting too when she complained about all the noise! Talk about
timing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening I head to the pub for a few beers with my Dad and Neil, we
talk cancer for a while as I update Neil and answer his questions and then we
dive into the normal pub talk - absolute rot and covering all subjects.  It’s
great to escape for a while and be normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a slight headache! Nothing too bad and my parents deliver the kids to
school whilst I work. They’ve been great this week and it’s been good to have
them on hand. They then head off for the day to see some friends nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia looks flushed today and I worry why that might be and she has a
slight temperature. She brushes it off and heads for coffee with Ginnies. She
still looks flushed when I get home, I take her tempurature and it’s up a little
so I’m now watching that. She rests up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia has a chemotherapy book recording her treatment that she has to have on
hand at all times.  In it there are certain directives about what you should do
if you feel ill or have a temperature or aches etc. It’s serious stuff the
medicines they give you today are strong and targetted. They stop all cells from
splitting and reproducing, leaving your immune system highly vulnerable to
infection, so vigulance is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have pizza for tea and then it’s Imogen’s gymnastics. She does great and
impresses granny by being able to do the splits. I drink a coffee and then pay
for it later when I can’t sleep. Julia heads to bed early, I take her temperature
again and it now is over 37.5C her book says I should call the nurse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia thinks I’m fussing but the nurse says she’ll speak to consultant and
comes back to me. As it’s so early on in treatment paracetamol is advised and
we’ll review tomorrow morning, if it’s still up they’ll have her in for blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The drugs are administered, and it’s all fine.  Once I’m finished they need to keep an eye on me as I could have a reaction to the Herceptin, so we wait for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, I’m given more steroids to take to reduce the chances of sickness over the next 3 days. I also have a lesson in injecting myself with an immunity boosting syringe.  That was quite odd.  All the times I’ve had needles stuck in me over the past 6 weeks or so, it’s always been someone else doing it, so I can look away and let them get on with it.  Not so this one, I have to actually stick it in myself.  I had a practice run with a dummy needle and a stress ball, then it was time for the main show.  There was an awkward pause whilst I took a deep breath, steeled myself and went for it.  Luckily it was fine.  The nurse was happy with my attempt and I’ll be trusted to do it unsupervised in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have my port site checked and they are also pleased that’s healed sufficiently so it looks like I’ll be able to have a bath tonight. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the designated time we were told they were happy, and we could go.  Before long we are home sitting down to lasagna with the bairns and grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tea, and a catch up on Pointless, I have my aforementioned bath, and then it’s off to bed.  It’s been a long couple of days, and I need to make sure I rest.  Ross goes to the pub.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Luckily, granny and grandad were on hand to get the bairns organised and to breakfast club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been an accident on the A1, so the trusty sat nav sent us different way to the hospital.  We get stuck in a bit of traffic around Hitchin, which makes us nervous, but we arrive in time and are soon settled into our room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nurses are very efficient and before long I’m hooked up to a drip, being pumped with saline, anti sickness drugs, and then the main feature, the chemo drugs.  Note to self, go to the loo before being hooked up to the machine.  It’s a Faff otherwise.  A few hours later, I’m detached, and sent on my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way home we pop to Argos and pick up a few Christmas presents.  It’s good to feel like we’re doing something positive for Christmas.  The timing of the treatments suck, but needs must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, we have lunch and then I try for a nap to catch up on some sleep.  I manage about 45 mins but then the bairns come in from school and want to check I’m ok after my treatment.  I’ve still got a line attached to my port as I’m back to the hospital tomorrow to start my Herceptin treatment, so they were interested in having a look at it.  I’m looking forward to having it taken out tomorrow and also the steri strips removed and dressing changed so that I can have a proper shower and bath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be having an early night tonight and trying to actually sleep through most of it.  Last night was no fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;He was fully awake by this point, so he watched last nights episode of Hebburn with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then talked about how grossly unfair this all was.  I can’t understand why the Cancer decided to have a go at me.  I realise I’m in danger of wallowing in self pity or worse slipping into depression, but I can’t help thinking ‘why me?’  What did I do to deserve this?  I also know that it’s just an unfortunate situation that is a result of chance and bad luck. Unfortunately the former is winning over the latter at the moment despite my stoicism and pragmatism, and until I learn to accept it, I will struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross managed to go back to sleep.  He needs as much sleep as he can get too.  Luckily as Ross’s parents are here, they are able to pick up the slack with things like cooking and looking after the bairns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen has told me she’s a little bit worried about my first chemo treatment and she is going to tell her teacher so they can offer her some support. I’m so glad she’s confident enough to do that, she is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felix asked if my hair would fall out straight away.  I think he was disappointed when I said no.  Felix doesn’t really understand what’s going on, so he focuses on the bits he does understand.  Bald heads he can relate to.  Ross has one after all!  If he sees tangible evidence like dressings, or scars, he can relate to that. He’s had and got those himself!  He’s asked to feel the Big Lump and the implanted port catheter, they are real and physical, but he doesn’t understand the implications of them all.  To be honest, no 5 year old, or 7 year old for that matter, should have to watch a parent fight this battle.  It’s not fair on them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On hair loss related news, I had a wig delivered.  I don’t like it.  I’m going to have to go to a wig shop and try some on.  The problem I have is, I have quite a small head, small forehead and a widow’s peak.  So to get a wig that sits right will prove tricky.  My wonderful hairdresser is going to see if there’s anything she can do with the internet wig, so at least I have a backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try for another hour of sleep now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall return.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Woot.  In fact, despite having cancer, all the various health checks I’ve had recently tell me I’m actually in pretty good shape.  This is good news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s all go for the chemo and herceptin on Wednesday and Thursday.  I’m feeling quite calm about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was driving to work this this morning, David Guetta’s Titanium came on.  “Shoot me down, but I won’t fall, I am Titanium”.  That’s me!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up and at ‘em after a terrible nights sleep on the lovely new matress.  Julia
was worried she would fall out and took over two thirds of the bed and no
amount of snoring would get her to move!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felix bounded out of bed as it’s Children In Need and pyjama day at school.
Imogen was less excited about the idea of the early rising. Michelle was a star
and took the kids at 6:30am as we dashed down the A1 and onto the M25 for the
9am appointment in Rickmansworth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff were great and we soon found out about Julia’s operation.  No general
anethestic needed so Julia was happy. I had some coding to do, so spent the
waiting period working and watching lectures for the online course I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short time after Julia is wheeled out, she’s back and still chilled out
from the sedatives.  She looks a million times better than she did after the
general and is keen for food and drink so they can discharge her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once free we have to take some bloods to Harpenden so Julia can be signed fit
for chemotherapy.  At the hospital Julia gets to meet the chemotherapy nurses
and they talk us through the process.  This answers some questions and wierdly
it all now feels more “normal” now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get home and Julia rests up. I get the kids from school but by 8:30pm I
can’t stay awake and head up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia seemed less scared about falling off the bed and we both manage to get a
good nights sleep.  It’s my parents 45th wedding anniversary today, I didn’t
think we’d make it but Julia is feeling well enough to go.  So we head off
to Newbury.  The M25 is a nightmare and we park for 30mins, I’m just glad it was
easy running the day before.  Once that wrinkle is out the way, we cruise to
Newbury and surprise my parents by phoning from outside their flat.  We have
a great lunch, it’s brilliant to see the family and to see Julia looking so great
and enjoying some fizzy wine! We head back in the early evening tired and
happy.  Julia is sore from Fridays operation and plans to have a well deserved
lie-in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I let Julia rest and take the kids to their swimming lessons.  We swim for an
hour and then after a cuppa it’s time to head home and do the chores.  I head
to the tip, do the laundry, go shopping, do the tidying and the cooking.  We
are now eating more vegetables and I’m not a fan of raw veg but it’s time to get
over that.  Felix is less enthusiastic initially but the kids barter between
themselves - some of the pepper slices for cucumber and peace is restored.  I
even smile whilst showing Felix I now like raw tomatos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I play some Lego Star Wars with the kids then I bully Julia
into an afternoon walk.  The doctors have said that exercise will help…
Its a grey old day, but the kids chase me kicking the rugby ball round Ivel
Springs.  We head home via the Orange Tree for a cheeky pint. Good day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents arrive at lunchtime they are over for the week to help out.  I take
them on the school run to pick up the kids and meet the teachers so they know
where to get them later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening Julia has her ECG the whole thing was funny, the Doctor was great,
slightly disorganised but the tells Julia she has a perfect heart.  We are
good to go for Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since my last post, there’s been a lot going on.  The Chemotherapy starts on Wednesday and in preparation, I’ve had a port fitted in my chest which all drugs will be dispensed through.  It’ll also be used for blood tests and will save the veins in my right arm.  I can’t have any blood tests, injections, or even blood pressure taken on my left arm ever again, as I’ve had so many lymph nodes taken out, so everything would have to be done on the right arm.  The port just saves it for the length of my treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure involved dropping the bairns off at Michelle’s at 6:30 on Friday morning (thank you), and then a trip to a hospital in North London.  A few hours, a local anaesthetic, light sedation, blood tests and some extra bits being fitted to me later, we’re off to another hospital to meet the Chemotherapy team.  My first Chemo treatment will be given on Wednesday, and the Herceptin will be given on Thursday.  They were all very nice, the rooms look nice, and we were sent on my way with some fairly hefty steroids which I start taking taking on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also got to have a heart scan on Monday as the Herceptin treatment can affect it and they need to get a base line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it’s not all been crazy cancer stuff.  It was Ross’s parents 45th Wedding Anniversary and before things went mental we were planning on spending the weekend with them and the rest of the family.  Early Saturday morning Ross asked me how I was feeling and we decided that we’d make the effort and go and visit them for the day.  I’m glad we did.  It was great to see everyone.  The bairns played nicely with their cousins and it was good to see Ross with his two brothers.  We travelled back and got home for early evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning comes and I’m tired, so Ross takes the bairns to their new swimming lessons.  I then have a fairly lazy day, but did go for a walk round Ivel Springs followed by a cheeky drink in the Orange Tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a visit from Anna.  She brings gifts from the Gin Club.  They are such an amazing bunch of ladies who know me very well.  It consisted of a blanket, socks, smellies, chocolate, fizzy wine, nail varnish and an iTunes voucher.  I’m blessed and touched that they took the time to do this for me.  They’ve also given me a photo album filled with photos taken at various Gin Club events. My challenge is to name and date the event.  The idea is I do it when I’m having my treatment to keep me occupied.  So thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m back to the office tomorrow.  That’s going to be odd.  I haven’t been in since before Halloween.  Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The good bit is that our new mattress has been delivered.  Greg and Rachel came round with Joni too.  Greg helped Ross sort the cat flap out, so that’s all working now.  Cats won’t go through it though…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the not so good bits…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started when I went to the doctors to pick up a prescription.  They told me it had been processed, but they couldn’t find it.  So I waited for half an hour whilst they searched for it, I even went to chemist to see if it had it, but to no avail.  I’m sorry to say I put on a sad face, and told them it was &lt;em&gt;whispers&lt;/em&gt; Cancer medication.  They then printed out a new prescription and got the doctor to sign it.  All that and then I was required to go and actually get the drugs from the pharmacy.  More waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get home, crack on with some work, and get a phone call from a hospital in North London asking me to confirm my appointment for tomorrow morning to insert a Portacath. What? Where? How?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some frantic phone calls, which Ross deals with, as I’m unable to take in any information, things start to become clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m having the Portacath inserted tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Monday I’m having a heart scan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Wednesday I start my chemotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to some great family and friends we have the kids covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scary times ahead though.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the morning we head off to see the clinical oncologist in Welwyn.
We arrive early and no sooner had I got the iPad out the doctor is there to see us.
The doctor is really nice and reassuring about chemotherapy, it might not be all
that bad, it depends and there’s lots they can do to help.  The aim of the
treatment is to cure Julia - that’s the destination and he’s keen to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s practical reasons to do chemotherapy first, it will kill the cancer quickly
and make the operation later easier as the tumor will have shrunk.  He explains
that he wants to get moving as soon as possible.  We had wanted to get the chemo
done locally but he explains some differences about NHS versus private and it’s a no
brainer. To get moving quickly and give Julia the best care it means staying in
private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early evening, I decide it’s a good time to fit the cat flap.  I don’t
know why it was suddenly important but it was. I got all the kit (and some more)
out of the garage, measured twice, cut once and it still wouldn’t fit as expected.
I had to cut some bolts and the nuts wouldn’t then go back on.  I picked up the
kids, went to Wickes asked for help and they only had electricians screws. Turns
out the nuts wouldn’t fit them either.  Shit.  I make tea, find some nuts that do
kind of fit and then cut the bolts too short.  Shit, Shit, Shit.  I give up and
have to walk away. My pride is wounded and it matters - of course it does, in
the grand scheme of things it’s inconsequential but that night it really mattered.
I retreat to the sofa in a huff as the cats skip merrily through the new hole in
the door.  A facebook SOS and Greg volunteers himself to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have nothing on today, no doctors, hospitals or waiting rooms Woot! I head
to the gym after dropping off the kids. The knee feels better than last week
and it’s good to de-stress.  I do notice I’m not as switched on as normal. I used
a couple of machines on the wrong settings and wondered why they felt odd, only
to notice I hadn’t moved the leg rest etc… I blame the lack of coffee but it
really is because I have become scatter brained. I have more and more things
taking up that limited resource up at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia annoys me when I get home because she is working but hasn’t had any breakfast
or coffee.  I tell her if she’s well enough to work, she’s well enough to make
herself breaky and it’s so crucial she eats, stays strong and looks after herself.
There’s been a few occassions recently where I’ve raised my eyebrows because
I’m carrying the can for her where she could so easily. I feel like that sounds
heartless and I’m whinging but I am stepping up and I’m happy to do so.
I won’t deny it’s tiring but also there are small things she can and has to do
for herself.  I remind her we are a team - TeamRJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new mattress arrives, the old one dragged into the garage waiting for the day
I have the time to get it to the tip. Greg, Rachel and Joni arrive and
Greg tells me how to file down cut bolts that don’t take a nut - 2 seconds of
rubbing the bolt on a brick and bingo.  Top tip that one! The next one is that
electricians pliers have threaded holes for cutting bolts (found that nugget out
on youtube yesterday).  Greg sorts the cat flap out in no time and I now owe him a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between all this and work, there’s been lots of phone calls sorting out Julia.
Tomorrow we are off to London for the portacath operation. Then monday its ECG,
Tuesday I’m off to have my jaw looked at.  Then wednesday and thursday Julia
is having chemotherapy and herceptin.  It’s going to be a busy week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theres some panic / concern when the insurance folks call about refusing a
certain drug - as its on a trial.  We hadn’t discussed this with the doctor but
it seems it was a punt on his behalf and he wasn’t hopeful so didn’t discuss it.
I’m chasing this one up to make sure and to double check it’s all tickety boo
for next week.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We now know I have Stage 2 Grade 3 Cancer.  We also know the TMN score.  This is T3 N2 M0.  Basically it means, there’s more than two lumps or tumours, it’s spread to 2 nodes, but it’s nowhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doctor today reiterated what the surgeon said, which is that they are treating me with a view to curing me.  Completely destroying or removing any and all cancer that may be lurking in my body.  This is good to know that everyone is on the same page as me.  I won’t be beaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next step is getting the chemotherapy underway.  This could start as early as Friday.  (Private health insurance comes up trumps again).  I’ll be having a Portocath fitted which will mean the drugs go straight into a vein in my chest rather than a needle in my arms.  To be honest, I don’t care.  I just want to get cracking and get rid of this horrible disease which has turned my life upside down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still having pain in my arm and shoulder which is getting annoying now.  Wish it would give it a rest.  I’m feeling like an invalid.  And quite fragile which is increasingly annoying me.  It’s something I’m going to have to get used to as it’s going to get worse before it gets better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Pinky told me when I bumped into her in Tesco, we need to stay positive.  I’m continuing to receive cards and messages of support, as well as hugs in supermarkets and school yards, and every single one is very much appreciated.
The phone calls to my Dad and Julie are also enormously helpful.  Talking to them helps put things in focus as it can get very blurry here at times.  Not least because I’m looking through tear filled eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I also quite like Westlife, which I realise makes me a sad human being, but I don’t actually care.  They had a hit with a song called “Swear it Again”.  Well I’ve been swearing again, and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been to the hospital today to get the results of my Lymph Node Biopsy.  It’s not the result we wanted.  The surgeon took out 3 initial nodes, and decided to take out 5 more whilst he was there.  Two of the initial three turned out to be cancerous.  The other five were clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we know what the next step is.  I see a Oncologist tomorrow to discuss the best way to get the chemotherapy started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll return to the surgeon in March for the mastectomy and further lymph node surgery.  Then it’ll be the Herceptin treatment, maybe radiotherapy, and after that it’ll be the reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m swearing…alot.  It wasn’t supposed to have spread.  It wasn’t supposed to be me, and I’m really, really angry.&lt;/p&gt;
