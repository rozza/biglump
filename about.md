We're a normal family of 4 - 2 kids (Imogen & Felix), 3 cats (Meg, Mog & Merlin)
and 2 gerbils (nibbles & crunch).  Then on Wednesday 23rd October 2013 Julia
was diagnosed with breast cancer.

This blog is our journey and our therapy.  Its important for us to express our
feelings and writing helps formulate and gather our thoughts.  This blog will have
posts from perspectives of both Julia and Ross.

We know the destination is a healthy Julia and we know some of the waypoints, we
don't know the order yet but we've started the journey.

Love the Lawleys.

Ps - Read it from the start [as it unfolds](/archive/).
